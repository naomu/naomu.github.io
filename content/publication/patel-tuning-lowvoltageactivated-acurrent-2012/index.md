abstract: Modulation of stimulus-response gain and stability of spontaneous (unstimulated)
  firing are both important for neural computation. However, biologically plausible
  mechanisms that allow these distinct functional capabilities to coexist in the same
  neuron are poorly defined. Low-threshold, inactivating (A-type) K(+) currents (I(A))
  are found in many biological neurons and are historically known for enabling low-frequency
  firing. By performing simulations using a conductance-based model neuron, here we
  show that biologically plausible shifts in I(A) conductance and inactivation kinetics
  produce dissociated effects on gain and intrinsic firing. This enables I(A) to regulate
  gain without major changes in intrinsic firing rate. Tuning I(A) properties may
  thus represent a previously unsuspected single-current mechanism of silent gain
  control in neurons.
