              * A population of developmentally primitive, fetal-like cells known to be associated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Colorectal Cancer appears to arise from reprogrammed intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). It is unclear which types of IECs are capable of being reprogrammed into this state or what becomes of these cells on the resolution of inflammation.
              * Designed a single cell RNA-seq analysis pipeline to identify disease-associated cells by integrating data from IBD model and wild type mice. Applied lineage analysis tools (CellRank) to make inferences about this population.
              * Successfully identified a putative fetal-like cell population and an associated signature within the data. Results indicated that plasticity to transition into the fetal-like state was not limited to a specific type of IEC but provided no evidence as to the fate of the cells.
              * Generated hypotheses for further testing by the lab, including the role of putative drivers of transitions to the fetal-like state such as reactive oxygen species-related transcription factors DUOX2 and DUOXA2.

              * Silent modulation of gain (the relationship between input current and output firing rate) enables a neuron to participate in neural computation and processing without altering its resting behaviour.
              * Adapted a MATLAB ODE-based model neuron to investigate gain and intrinsic firing for a range of biologically plausible values of time constant of activation/inactivation and voltage dependence of inactivation.
              * Results suggest that tuning A-type channel inactivation voltage can silently modulate gain & offer a potential mechanism for A-type channel tuning by neuromodulators observed elsewhere.
              * Project was adapted into a paper.
