The ability to track the evolutionary dynamics of early-stage lung cancer non-invasively in circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) has not yet been demonstrated. Here we use a tumour-specific phylogenetic approach to profile the ctDNA of the first 100 TRACERx (Tracking Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Evolution Through Therapy (Rx)) study participants, including one patient who was also recruited to the PEACE (Posthumous Evaluation of Advanced Cancer Environment) post-mortem study. We identify independent predictors of ctDNA release and analyse the tumour-volume detection limit. Through blinded profiling of postoperative plasma, we observe evidence of adjuvant chemotherapy resistance and identify patients who are very likely to experience recurrence of their lung cancer. Finally, we show that phylogenetic ctDNA profiling tracks the subclonal nature of lung cancer relapse and metastasis, providing a new approach for ctDNA-driven therapeutic studies.},

In this review we will discuss novel treatment target agents including selective janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, anti-interleukin (IL) (IL-12/IL-23), leukocyte trafficking/migrating inhibitors (such as sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator) and other small molecules currently in development.},

  abstract = {In recent years, rapid developments in genomics and proteomics have generated a large amount of biological data. Drawing conclusions from these data requires sophisticated computational analyses. Bioinformatics is the interdisciplinary science of interpreting biological data using information technology and computer science. The importance of this new field of inquiry will grow as we continue to generate and integrate large quantities of genomic, proteomic, and other data. As the amount of data grows exponentially, there is a parallel growth in the demand for tools and methods in data management, visualization, integration, analysis, modeling and prediction. Bioinformatics plays an essential role in today's plant pathology with regards to the development of new plant diagnostic tools. Pathogen is among the traits considered in the primary interest of plant bioinformatics. The contribution of bioinformatics advances made possible the mapping of the entire genomes of many organisms in just over a decade. These discoveries, along with current efforts to determine gene and protein functions, have improved the ability to understand the root causes of plant diseases and find new cures. Furthermore, many future bioinformatics innovations will likely be spurred by the data and analysis demands of the life sciences. Bioinformatics have many practical applications in current plant disease management with respect to the study of host-pathogen interactions, understanding the disease genetics and pathogencity factor of a pathogen which ultimately help in designing best management options. This review paper describes some of the key concepts and databases used in bioinformatics, with an emphasis on those relevant to plant science. It also covers some aspects with regards to the role application of this endeavor science in today's plant disease management strategies.},

However, appropriate analysis and utilization of the massive amounts of data generated from single-cell RNA sequencing experiments are challenging and require an understanding of the experimental and computational pathways taken between preparation of input cells and output of interpretable data. In this review, we will discuss the basic principles of these new technologies, focusing on concepts important in the analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data. Specifically, we summarize approaches to quality-control measures for determination of which single cells to include for further examination, methods of data normalization and scaling to overcome the relatively inefficient capture rate of mRNA from each cell, and clustering and visualization algorithms used for dimensional reduction of the data to a two-dimensional plot.},

To better understand the spread of infection in the affected countries, it is crucial to know the number of secondary cases generated by an infected index case in the absence and presence of control measures, i.e., the basic and effective reproduction number. In this study, I describe the EBOV epidemic using an SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model and fit the model to the most recent reported data of infected cases and deaths in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. The maximum likelihood estimates of the basic reproduction number are 1.51 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.50-1.52) for Guinea, 2.53 (95\% CI: 2.41-2.67) for Sierra Leone and 1.59 (95\% CI: 1.57-1.60) for Liberia. The model indicates that in Guinea and Sierra Leone the effective reproduction number might have dropped to around unity by the end of May and July 2014, respectively. In Liberia, however, the model estimates no decline in the effective reproduction number by end-August 2014. This suggests that control efforts in Liberia need to be improved substantially in order to stop the current outbreak.},

In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSIBLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities.

Current methodological approaches could better elucidate the cytokine pathways and the genetics involved in the etiopathogenesis of this disease. Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines that play a key role in autoimmune/inflammatory disorders because of their pro- and anti-inflammatory properties as well as their immunoregulatory functions. An increased expression of IFN-regulated genes, widely known as an IFN signature, has been reported in blood and tissue from patients with autoimmune disorders. In this review, we present the function as well as the clinical and therapeutic potential of the IFN signature. Current data demonstrate that the IFN signature can be used as a biomarker that defines disease activity in autoimmune diseases, although this has not been thoroughly studied in IBD. Consequently, further investigation of the IFN signature in IBD would be essential for a better understanding of its actions.},

  abstract = {Understanding the complexity of cellular function within a tissue necessitates the combination of multiple phenotypic readouts. Here, we developed a method that links spatially-resolved gene expression of single cells with their ultrastructural morphology by integrating multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) and large area volume electron microscopy (EM) on adjacent tissue sections. Using this method, we characterized in situ ultrastructural and transcriptional responses of glial cells and infiltrating T-cells after demyelinating brain injury in male mice. We identified a population of lipid-loaded ``foamy'' microglia located in the center of remyelinating lesion, as well as rare interferon-responsive microglia, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes that co-localized with T-cells. We validated our findings using immunocytochemistry and lipid staining-coupled single-cell RNA sequencing. Finally, by integrating these datasets, we detected correlations between full-transcriptome gene expression and ultrastructural features of microglia. Our results offer an integrative view of the spatial, ultrastructural, and transcriptional reorganization of single cells after demyelinating brain injury. To understand complexity of cellular function, multiple phenotypic readouts are needed. Here, authors devised an approach integrating location, transcriptome, ultrastructure, and lipid content to characterize single-cell states after brain injury.},

Acute UC was induced in Balb/C mice by oral administration of 5\% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). The disease activity index was evaluated, and a histologic study was carried out. Orally administered shikonin reduces induced UC in a dose-dependent manner, preventing the shortening of the colorectum and decreasing weight loss by 5\% while improving the appearance of feces and preventing bloody stools. The disease activity index score was much lower in shikonin-treated mice than in the colitic group, as well as the myeloperoxidase activity. The expression of cyclooxygenase-2 was reduced by 75\%, activation of NF-{$\kappa$}B was reduced by 44\%, and that of pSTAT-3 by 47\%, as well as TNF-{$\alpha$}, IL-1{$\beta$}, and IL-6 production. Similar results were obtained in primary macrophages culture. This is the first report of shikonin's ability to attenuate acute UC induced by DSS. Shikonin acts by blocking the activation of two major targets: NF-{$\kappa$}B and STAT-3, and thus constitutes a promising potential therapeutic agent for the management of the inflammatory bowel disease.},

  abstract = {To end the largest known outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa and to prevent new transmissions, rapid epidemiological tracing of cases and contacts was required. The ability to quickly identify unknown sources and chains of transmission is key to ending the EVD epidemic and of even greater importance in the context of recent reports of Ebola virus (EBOV) persistence in survivors. Phylogenetic analysis of complete EBOV genomes can provide important information on the source of any new infection. A local deep sequencing facility was established at the Mateneh Ebola Treatment Centre in central Sierra Leone. The facility included all wetlab and computational resources to rapidly process EBOV diagnostic samples into full genome sequences. We produced 554 EBOV genomes from EVD cases across Sierra Leone. These genomes provided a detailed description of EBOV evolution and facilitated phylogenetic tracking of new EVD cases. Importantly, we show that linked genomic and epidemiological data can not only support contact tracing but also identify unconventional transmission chains involving body fluids, including semen. Rapid EBOV genome sequencing, when linked to epidemiological information and a comprehensive database of virus sequences across the outbreak, provided a powerful tool for public health epidemic control efforts.},

Little is known about the cancer risk in familial inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We assessed the significance of familial CRC, or IBD, on the risk for CRC in patients with IBD. METHODS: Population-based cohort study of 19,876 individuals with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease born between 1941 and 1995. Registry-based follow-up and assessment of familial CRC, and IBD. Risk of CRC assessed as incidence proportion ("absolute risk," IP) and relative risk (RR). RESULTS: Familial CRC was associated with a more than 2-fold risk of CRC (adjusted RR = 2.5, 95\% confidence interval 1.4-4.4) and an increase in the IP of CRC at 54 years of age from 3.8\% to 6.9\%. Patients with a first-degree relative diagnosed with CRC before 50 years of age had a higher RR (9.2, 95\% confidence interval 3.7-23) and the highest IP (29\%). No association with familial IBD was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Information on family history of CRC may be a simple way to identify individuals with IBD at elevated risk of developing CRC.},

The outbreak then spread to the capital, Conakry, and to neighboring countries and has subsequently become the largest epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) to date. METHODS: From March 25 to April 26, 2014, we performed a study of all patients with laboratory-confirmed EVD in Conakry. Mortality was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included patient characteristics, complications, treatments, and comparisons between survivors and nonsurvivors. RESULTS: Of 80 patients who presented with symptoms, 37 had laboratory-confirmed EVD. Among confirmed cases, the median age was 38 years (interquartile range, 28 to 46), 24 patients (65\%) were men, and 14 (38\%) were health care workers; among the health care workers, nosocomial transmission was implicated in 12 patients (32\%). Patients with confirmed EVD presented to the hospital a median of 5 days (interquartile range, 3 to 7) after the onset of symptoms, most commonly with fever (in 84\% of the patients; mean temperature, 38.6{\textdegree}C), fatigue (in 65\%), diarrhea (in 62\%), and tachycardia (mean heart rate, {$>$}93 beats per minute). Of these patients, 28 (76\%) were treated with intravenous fluids and 37 (100\%) with antibiotics. Sixteen patients (43\%) died, with a median time from symptom onset to death of 8 days (interquartile range, 7 to 11). Patients who were 40 years of age or older, as compared with those under the age of 40 years, had a relative risk of death of 3.49 (95\% confidence interval, 1.42 to 8.59; P=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with EVD presented with evidence of dehydration associated with vomiting and severe diarrhea. Despite attempts at volume repletion, antimicrobial therapy, and limited laboratory services, the rate of death was 43\%.},

Phenotypic variation can be observed as intratumor heterogeneity, which is propagated by genome instability leading to mutations, somatic copy-number alterations, and epigenomic changes. TRACERx was set up in 2014 to observe the relationship between intratumor heterogeneity and patient outcome. By integrating multiregion sequencing of primary tumors with longitudinal sampling of a prospectively recruited patient cohort, cancer evolution can be tracked from early- to late-stage disease and through therapy. Here we review some of the key features of the studies and look to the future of the field. SIGNIFICANCE: Cancers evolve and adapt to environmental challenges such as immune surveillance and treatment pressures. The TRACERx studies track cancer evolution in a clinical setting, through primary disease to recurrence. Through multiregion and longitudinal sampling, evolutionary processes have been detailed in the tumor and the immune microenvironment in non-small cell lung cancer and clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. TRACERx has revealed the potential therapeutic utility of targeting clonal neoantigens and ctDNA detection in the adjuvant setting as a minimal residual disease detection tool primed for translation into clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enable the study of transcriptional heterogeneity at the resolution of individual cells and have an increasing impact on biomedical research. However, it is known that these methods sometimes wrongly consider two or more cells as single cells, and that a number of so-called doublets is present in the output of such experiments. Treating doublets as single cells in downstream analyses can severely bias a study's conclusions, and therefore computational strategies for the identification of doublets are needed.With scds, we propose two new approaches for in silico doublet identification: Co-expression based doublet scoring (cxds) and binary classification based doublet scoring (bcds). The co-expression based approach, cxds, utilizes binarized (absence/presence) gene expression data and, employing a binomial model for the co-expression of pairs of genes, yields interpretable doublet annotations. bcds, on the other hand, uses a binary classification approach to discriminate artificial doublets from original data. We apply our methods and existing computational doublet identification approaches to four datasets with experimental doublet annotations and find that our methods perform at least as well as the state of the art, at comparably little computational cost. We observe appreciable differences between methods and across datasets and that no approach dominates all others. In summary, scds presents a scalable, competitive approach that allows for doublet annotation of datasets with thousands of cells in a matter of seconds.scds is implemented as a Bioconductor R package (doi: 10.18129/B9.bioc.scds).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

In this review, we discuss a representative set of online virtual screening servers and their underlying similarity algorithms. Other related topics, such as molecular representation or freely accessible databases are also treated. The most relevant contributions to this review arise from critical discussions concerning the pros and cons of servers and algorithms, and the challenges that future works must solve in a virtual screening framework.},

We review models used to study the mechanisms by which intestinal stem cells (ISCs) fuel the rapid turnover of the epithelium during homeostasis and might support epithelial regeneration after injury. In anatomically defined zones of the crypt stem cell niche, phenotypically distinct active and reserve ISC populations are believed to support homeostatic epithelial renewal and injury-induced regeneration, respectively. However, other cell types previously thought to be committed to differentiated states might also have ISC activity and participate in regeneration. Efforts are underway to reconcile the proposed relatively strict hierarchical relationships between reserve and active ISC pools and their differentiated progeny; findings from models provide evidence for phenotypic plasticity that is common among many if not all crypt-resident intestinal epithelial cells. We discuss the challenges to consensus on ISC nomenclature, technical considerations and limitations inherent to methodologies used to define reserve ISCs, and the need for standardized metrics to quantify and compare the relative contributions of different epithelial cell types to homeostatic turnover and post-injury regeneration. Increasing our understanding of the high-resolution genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that regulate reserve ISC function and cell plasticity will help refine these models and could affect approaches to promote tissue regeneration following intestinal injury.},

This algorithmic challenge has become particularly pressing with the emergence of long, high-fidelity (HiFi) reads that have been recently used to generate a semi-manual telomere-to-telomere assembly of the human genome. To enable automated assemblies of long, HiFi reads, we present the La Jolla Assembler (LJA), a fast algorithm using the Bloom filter, sparse de Bruijn graphs and disjointig generation. LJA reduces the error rate in HiFi reads by three orders of magnitude, constructs the de Bruijn graph for large genomes and large k-mer sizes and transforms it into a multiplex de Bruijn graph with varying k-mer sizes. Compared to state-of-the-art assemblers, our algorithm not only achieves five-fold fewer misassemblies but also generates more contiguous assemblies. We demonstrate the utility of LJA via the automated assembly of a human genome that completely assembled six chromosomes.},

We investigate the effect on results of basing evidence of correlations on two phylogenetic approaches, Dollo parsminony and maximum likelihood (ML). We further examine the effect of constraining the ML model by fixing the rate of gene gain at a low value, rather than estimating it from the data.Results: We detect correlated evolution among a test set of pairs of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) genes, with a case study of 21 eukaryotic genomes and test data derived from known yeast protein complexes. If the rate at which genes are gained is constrained to be low, ML achieves by far the best results at detecting known functional links. The model then has fewer parameters but it is more realistic by preventing genes from being gained more than once.Availability: BayesTraits by M. Pagel and A.

Across-species correlation methods for detecting functional links work on the premise that functionally linked proteins will tend to show a common pattern of presence and absence across a range of genomes. We describe a maximum likelihood statistical model for predicting functional gene linkages. The method detects independent instances of the correlated gain or loss of pairs of proteins on phylogenetic trees, reducing the high rates of false positives observed in conventional across-species methods that do not explicitly incorporate a phylogeny. We show, in a dataset of 10,551 protein pairs, that the phylogenetic method improves by up to 35\% on across-species analyses at identifying known functionally linked proteins. The method shows that protein pairs with at least two to three correlated events of gain or loss are almost certainly functionally linked. Contingent evolution, in which one gene's presence or absence depends upon the presence of another, can also be detected phylogenetically, and may identify genes whose functional significance depends upon its interaction with other genes. Incorporating phylogenetic information improves the prediction of functional linkages. The improvement derives from having a lower rate of false positives and from detecting trends that across-species analyses miss. Phylogenetic methods can easily be incorporated into the screening of large-scale bioinformatics datasets to identify sets of protein links and to characterise gene networks.},

We model the potential consequences of the Omicron variant on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and health outcomes in England between December 2021 and April 2022, using a deterministic compartmental model fitted to epidemiological data from March 2020 onwards. Because of uncertainty around the characteristics of Omicron, we explore scenarios varying the extent of Omicron's immune escape and the effectiveness of COVID-19 booster vaccinations against Omicron, assuming the level of Omicron's transmissibility relative to Delta to match the growth in observed S gene target failure data in England. We consider strategies for the re-introduction of control measures in response to projected surges in transmission, as well as scenarios varying the uptake and speed of COVID-19 booster vaccinations and the rate of Omicron's introduction into the population. These results suggest that Omicron has the potential to cause substantial surges in cases, hospital admissions and deaths in populations with high levels of immunity, including England. The reintroduction of additional non-pharmaceutical interventions may be required to prevent hospital admissions exceeding the levels seen in England during the previous peak in winter 2020{\textendash}2021.},

Cancer-specific gene-expression profiles stem from gene regulatory networks fueled by genetic and epigenetic defects, and by abnormal signals of the tumor microenvironment. These oncogenic signals ultimately engage the transcriptional machinery on the cis -regulatory elements of a host of effector genes, through recruitment of transcription factors (TFs), co-activators and chromatin regulators. That said, whether gene -expression in cancer cells is the chaotic product of myriad regulations or rather a relatively ordered process orchestrated by few TFs (master regulators) has long remained enigmatic. Recent work on the YAP/TAZ co-activators has been instrumental to break new ground into this outstanding issue, revealing that tumor cells hijack growth programs that are active during development and regeneration through engagement of a small set of interconnected TFs and their nuclear partners.},

Understanding their regulatory mechanisms during tissue homeostasis is key to delineating their roles in development and regeneration, as well as diseases such as bowel cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. Previous studies of ISCs focused mainly on the position of these cells along the intestinal crypt and their capacity for multipotency. However, evidence increasingly suggests that ISCs also exist in distinct cellular states, which can be an acquired rather than a hardwired intrinsic property. In this Review, we summarise the recent findings into how ISC identity can be defined by proliferation state, signalling crosstalk, epigenetics and metabolism, and propose an update on the hallmarks of ISCs. We further discuss how these properties contribute to intestinal development and the dynamics of injury-induced regeneration.},

  abstract = {Background \& Aims Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for hospitalized patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC). However, whether the addition/continuation of mesalamine with corticosteroids during hospitalization is superior to corticosteroids alone is unknown. Methods This was a randomized controlled, investigator-blinded, clinical trial conducted in 10 centers in 7 countries. Patients hospitalized with ASUC (Lichtiger score {$\geq$}10) were eligible. Patients received corticosteroids alone or corticosteroid~+ mesalamine (4 g/day mesalamine) by a stratified randomization according to mesalamine use before admission. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients who responded to treatment by day 7, defined by a drop {$>$}3 points in the Lichtiger score and an absolute score {$<$}10 without the need for rescue medications or colectomy. Results Three hundred forty-six patients were screened, and 149 were included (70/149 female; median age, 41 years). Of these, 73 received corticosteroids~+ mesalamine, and 76 received corticosteroids alone. For the primary outcome, 53 of 73 patients (72.6\%) receiving corticosteroids with mesalamine responded versus 58 of 76 patients (76.3\%) on corticosteroids alone (odds ratio, 0.82; 95\% confidence interval, 0.39{\textendash}1.72; P~= .60). There was no difference between groups in duration of hospitalization, C-reactive protein normalization rate, or colectomy rate up to day 90. The need for biologics among patients receiving combination of corticosteroids with mesalamine was numerically lower by day 30 (P~= .11) and day 90 (P~= .07). Conclusions In this randomized controlled trial, combination of mesalamine with corticosteroids did not benefit hospitalized patients with ASUC more than corticosteroids alone. An exploratory signal for a reduced need for biologics at 90 days in the mesalamine group merits further evaluation. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01941589.},

This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial.

  abstract = {Control of intestinal epithelial stemness is crucial for tissue homeostasis. Disturbances in epithelial function are implicated in inflammatory and neoplastic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Here we report that mitochondrial function plays a critical role in maintaining intestinal stemness and homeostasis. Using intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific mouse models, we show that loss of HSP60, a mitochondrial chaperone, activates the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (MT-UPR) and results in mitochondrial dysfunction. HSP60-deficient crypts display loss of stemness and cell proliferation, accompanied by epithelial release of WNT10A and RSPO1. Sporadic failure of Cre-mediated Hsp60 deletion gives rise to hyperproliferative crypt foci originating from OLFM4+ stem cells. These effects are independent of the MT-UPR-associated transcription factor CHOP. In conclusion, compensatory hyperproliferation of HSP60+ escaper stem cells suggests paracrine release of WNT-related factors from HSP60-deficient, functionally impaired IEC to be pivotal in the control of the proliferative capacity of the stem cell niche.,  It is unclear what role mitochondrial function plays in maintaining intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) homeostasis. Here, the authors deplete a mitochondrial chaperone, heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) in IEC and observe a loss of stemness and cell proliferation, and suggest this is accompanied by a compensatory release of WNT-related factors.},

Lgr5+ crypt base columnar (CBC) cells act as stem cells during homeostasis and are essential during regeneration. Upon perturbation, the activity of CBCs is dynamically regulated to maintain homeostasis and multiple dedicated progenitor cell populations can reverse to the stem cell state upon damage, adding another layer of compensatory mechanisms to facilitate regeneration. Here, we review our current understanding of how intestinal stem and progenitor cells contribute to homeostasis and regeneration, and the different signaling pathways that regulate their behavior.

  abstract = {Toxic cyanobacterial blooms threaten freshwaters worldwide but have proven difficult to predict because the mechanisms of bloom formation and toxin production are unknown, especially on weekly time scales. Water quality management continues to focus on aggregated metrics, such as chlorophyll and total nutrients, which may not be sufficient to explain complex community changes and functions such as toxin production. For example, nitrogen (N) speciation and cycling play an important role, on daily time scales, in shaping cyanobacterial communities because declining N has been shown to select for N fixers. In addition, subsequent N pulses from N2 fixation may stimulate and sustain toxic cyanobacterial growth. Herein, we describe how rapid early summer declines in N followed by bursts of N fixation have shaped cyanobacterial communities in a eutrophic lake (Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, USA), possibly driving toxic Microcystis blooms throughout the growing season. On weekly time scales in 2010 and 2011, we monitored the cyanobacterial community in a eutrophic lake using the phycocyanin intergenic spacer (PC-IGS) region to determine population dynamics. In parallel, we measured microcystin concentrations, N2 fixation rates, and potential environmental drivers that contribute to structuring the community. In both years, cyanobacterial community change was strongly correlated with dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations, and Aphanizomenon and Microcystis alternated dominance throughout the pre-toxic, toxic, and post-toxic phases of the lake. Microcystin concentrations increased a few days after the first significant N2 fixation rates were observed. Then, following large early summer N2 fixation events, Microcystis increased and became most abundant. Maximum microcystin concentrations coincided with Microcystis dominance. In both years, DIN concentrations dropped again in late summer, and N2 fixation rates and Aphanizomenon abundance increased before the lake mixed in the fall. Estimated N inputs from N2 fixation were large enough to supplement, or even support, the toxic Microcystis blooms.},

Colonic goblet cells are responsible for generating the two mucus layers that physically separate the luminal microbiota from the host epithelium.

This cell non-specifically endocytoses and reacts to TLR2/1, TLR4 and TLR5 ligands by activating the NLRP6 inflammasome downstream of TLR-MyD88-dependent Nox/Duox ROS synthesis. This triggers Ca2+-dependent compound MUC2 exocytosis from the senGC and generates an intercellular gap junction signal that induces MUC2 secretion from adjacent goblet cells in the upper crypt which expels bacteria. Thus, senGCs guard and protect the colonic crypt from bacterial intruders that have penetrated the inner mucus layer.},

From the 1950s to 1970s, considerable numbers of N2-fixing bacteria were found to be associated with the crop, but it was not until the late 1980s that evidence from N balance and 15N dilution experiments showed that some Brazilian varieties of sugarcane were able to obtain significant contributions from this source. The results of these studies renewed the efforts to search for N2-fixing bacteria, but this time the emphasis was on those diazotrophs that infected the interior of the plants. Within a few years several species of such `endophytic diazotrophs' were discovered including Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus, Herbaspirillum seropedicae, H. rubrisubalbicans and Burkholderia sp. Work has continued on these endophytes within sugarcane plants, but to date little success has been attained in elucidating which endophyte is responsible for the observed BNF and in what site, or sites, within the cane plants the N2 fixation mainly occurs. Until such important questions are answered further developments or extension of this novel N2-fixing system to other economically important non-legumes (e.g. cereals) will be seriously hindered. As far as application of present knowledge to maximise BNF with sugarcane is concerned, molybdenum is an essential micronutrient. An abundant water supply favours high BNF inputs, and the best medium term strategy to increase BNF would appear to be based on cultivar selection on irrigated N deficient soils fertilised with Mo.},

  abstract = {APC normally down-regulates WNT signaling in human colon, and APC mutations cause proliferative abnormalities in premalignant crypts leading to colon cancer, but the mechanisms are unclear at the level of spatial and functional organization of the crypt. Accordingly, we postulated a counter-current-like mechanism based on gradients of factors (APC;WNT) that regulate colonocyte proliferation along the crypt axis. During crypt renewal, stem cells (SCs) at the crypt bottom generate non-SC daughter cells that proliferate and differentiate while migrating upwards. The APC concentration is low at the crypt bottom and high at the top (where differentiated cells reside). WNT signaling, in contrast, is high at the bottom (where SCs reside) and low at the top. Given that WNT and APC gradients are counter to one another, we hypothesized that a counter-current-like mechanism exists. Since both APC and WNT signaling components (e.g., survivin) are required for mitosis, this mechanism establishes a zone in the lower crypt where conditions are optimal for maximal cell division and mitosis orientation (symmetric versus asymmetric). APC haploinsufficiency diminishes the APC gradient, shifts the proliferative zone upwards, and increases symmetric division, which causes SC overpopulation. In homozygote mutant crypts, these changes are exacerbated. Thus, APC-mutation-induced changes in the counter-current-like mechanism cause expansion of proliferative populations (SCs, rapidly proliferating cells) during tumorigenesis. We propose this mechanism also drives crypt fission, functions in the crypt cycle, and underlies adenoma development. Novel chemoprevention approaches designed to normalize the two gradients and readjust the proliferative zone downwards, might thwart progression of these premalignant changes.},

The effect of N availability on vitamin synthesis is also evident in the non-diazotrophic strain, as they release five times more B12 under N-replete conditions relative to N-limiting conditions, although this value is still an order of magnitude smaller than the amount produced by the diazotroph. The cyanobacterial contribution to the oceanic B12 supply may be 50 times higher than the contribution of heterotrophic bacteria. Oceanic cyanobacteria do not compete for exogenous B12 with other prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but instead are obligate producers, thereby defining a unique dual ecological role for N2-fixing cyanobacteria in the oligotrophic ocean. They provide both a source of ``new'' bioavailable nitrogen and the B12 needed to support the growth of larger auxotrophic eukaryotic phytoplankton important for the biological carbon pump.},

  abstract = {Summary: This review summarizes recent aspects of (di)nitrogen fixation and (di)hydrogen metabolism, with emphasis on cyanobacteria. These organisms possess several types of the enzyme complexes catalyzing N2 fixation and/or H2 formation or oxidation, namely, two Mo nitrogenases, a V nitrogenase, and two hydrogenases. The two cyanobacterial Ni hydrogenases are differentiated as either uptake or bidirectional hydrogenases. The different forms of both the nitrogenases and hydrogenases are encoded by different sets of genes, and their organization on the chromosome can vary from one cyanobacterium to another. Factors regulating the expression of these genes are emerging from recent studies. New ideas on the potential physiological and ecological roles of nitrogenases and hydrogenases are presented. There is a renewed interest in exploiting cyanobacteria in solar energy conversion programs to generate H2 as a source of combustible energy. To enhance the rates of H2 production, the emphasis perhaps needs not to be on more efficient hydrogenases and nitrogenases or on the transfer of foreign enzymes into cyanobacteria. A likely better strategy is to exploit the use of radiant solar energy by the photosynthetic electron transport system to enhance the rates of H2 formation and so improve the chances of utilizing cyanobacteria as a source for the generation of clean energy.},

The formulas presented for test statistics and related estimating equations are applicable generally to quasi-likelihood models specified by an arbitrary mean value function {$\mu$}(x; {$\beta$}), together with a variance function V({$\mu$}; {$\varphi$}) that contains one or more unknown parameters. Two versions of the Wald and score tests are investigated--one calculated from the usual model-based covariance matrix whose validity depends on correct specification of the variance function, and another using an "empirical" covariance matrix that has a more general asymptotic justification. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the quasi-likelihood/method of moments (QL/M) procedures yield approximately unbiased estimates of regression coefficients and their standard errors and that model-based Wald, score, and deviance tests approximate the nominal size at the 5\% level for moderate sample sizes. The simpler Poisson analysis also produces approximately unbiased regression coefficients, even though the overdispersion is not accounted for. Although tests and standard errors based on Poisson theory are seriously in error in the presence of overdispersion, the empirical standard errors and especially the empirical score test obtained in conjunction with the Poisson analysis perform reasonably well with overdispersed data provided the sample size is sufficiently large. They perform less well in small samples than do the model-based QL/M procedures, probably because of the lack of precision in the empirical variances. These methods have important applications in epidemiology, toxicology, and related areas.},

  abstract = {Chronic inflammation is an established risk factor for the onset of cancer, and the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 has a role in tumorigenesis by enhancing proliferation and hindering apoptosis. As factors stimulating proliferation also downregulate p53 expression by enhancing ribosome biogenesis, we hypothesized that IL-6 may cause similar changes in inflamed tissues, thus activating a mechanism that favors neoplastic transformation. Here, we showed that IL-6 downregulated the expression and activity of p53 in transformed and untransformed human cell lines. This was the consequence of IL-6-dependent stimulation of c-MYC mRNA translation, which was responsible for the upregulation of rRNA transcription. The enhanced rRNA transcription stimulated the MDM2-mediated proteasomal degradation of p53, by reducing the availability of ribosome proteins for MDM2 binding. The p53 downregulation induced the acquisition of cellular phenotypic changes characteristic of epithelial{\textendash}mesenchymal transition, such as a reduced level of E-cadherin expression, increased cell invasiveness and a decreased response to cytotoxic stresses. We found that these changes also occurred in colon epithelial cells of patients with ulcerative colitis, a very representative example of chronic inflammation at high risk for tumor development. Histochemical and immunohistochemical analysis of colon biopsy samples showed an upregulation of ribosome biogenesis, a reduced expression of p53, together with a focal reduction or absence of E-cadherin expression in chronic colitis in comparison with normal mucosa samples. These changes disappeared after treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs. Taken together, the present results highlight a new mechanism that may link chronic inflammation to cancer, based on p53 downregulation, which is activated by the enhancement of rRNA transcription upon IL-6 exposure.},

AIM: To review the rates of and risk factors for clinical and endoscopic recurrence in population-based studies, referral centres and randomised controlled trials. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (source PUBMED, 1966 to September, 2011). RESULTS: In randomised controlled trials, clinical recurrence in the first year after surgery occurred in 10-38\% of patients, whereas endoscopic recurrence in the first year was reported in 35-85\% of patients. In population-based studies, approximately half of patients experienced clinical recurrence at 10~years. In referral centres, 48-93\% of the patients had endoscopic lesions (Rutgeerts' score {$\geq$}1) in the neoterminal ileum within 1~year after surgery, whereas 20-37\% had symptoms suggestive of clinical recurrence. Three years after surgery, the endoscopic postoperative recurrence rate increased to 85-100\%, and symptomatic recurrence occurred in 34-86\% of patients. Smoking is the strongest risk factor for postoperative recurrence, increasing by twofold, the risk of clinical recurrence. Prior intestinal resection, penetrating behaviour, perianal disease and extensive bowel disease ({$>$}50~cm) are established risk factors for postoperative recurrence. Risk factors for postoperative recurrence remain poorly defined in population-based cohorts. CONCLUSION: Endoscopic and clinical postoperative recurrence remains common in patients with Crohn's disease, and the identification of risk factors may allow targeted strategies to reduce this recurrence rate.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have identified and begun to characterize the roles of regenerative cellular plasticity in many organs. In Part I of our two-part Review, we discussed how cells reprogram following injury to the stomach and pancreas. We introduced the concept of a conserved cellular program, much like those governing division and death, which may allow mature cells to become regenerative. This program, paligenosis, is likely necessary to help organs repair the numerous injuries they face over the lifetime of an organism; however, we also postulated that rounds of paligenosis and redifferentiation may allow long-lived cells to accumulate and store oncogenic mutations, and could thereby contribute to tumorigenesis. We have termed the model wherein differentiated cells can store mutations and then unmask them upon cell cycle re-entry the `cyclical hit' model of tumorigenesis. In the present Review (Part II), we discuss these concepts, and cell plasticity as a whole, in the skin and intestine. Although differentiation and repair are arguably more thoroughly studied in skin and intestine than in stomach and pancreas, it is less clear how mature skin and intestinal cells contribute to tumorigenesis. Moreover, we conclude our Review by discussing plasticity in all four organs, and look for conserved mechanisms and concepts that might help advance our knowledge of tumor formation and advance the development of therapies for treating or preventing cancers that might be shared across multiple organs.},

Inactivation of YAP causes no obvious intestinal defects under normal homeostasis, but severely impairs DSS-induced intestinal regeneration. Conversely, hyperactivation of YAP results in widespread early-onset polyp formation following DSS treatment. Thus, the YAP oncoprotein must be exquisitely controlled in tissue regeneration to allow compensatory proliferation and prevent the intrinsic oncogenic potential of a tissue regeneration program.},

Constant research has led to a better understanding of the disease condition and further promoted its management. We here reviewed the conventional and the novel drugs and therapies, as well as the potential ones, which have shown promise in preclinical studies and are likely to be effective future therapies. The conventional treatments aim at controlling symptoms through pharmacotherapy, including aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologics, with other general measures and/or surgical resection if necessary. However, a considerable fraction of patients do not respond to available treatments or lose response, which calls for new therapeutic strategies. Diverse therapeutic options are emerging, involving small molecules, apheresis therapy, improved intestinal microecology, cell therapy, and exosome therapy. In addition, patient education partly upgrades the efficacy of IBD treatment. Recent advances in the management of IBD have led to a paradigm shift in the treatment goals, from targeting symptom-free daily life to shooting for mucosal healing. In this review, the latest progress in IBD treatment is summarized to understand the advantages, pitfalls, and research prospects of different drugs and therapies and to provide a basis for the clinical decision and further research of IBD.},

While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications. RESULTS: We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site. CONCLUSION: The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences. We have also improved the user interface of the command-line applications.},

Dynamic fluctuations between different states, within or across lineages, are regulated by changes in chromatin accessibility and in gene expression. When deregulated, cellular plasticity can contribute to cancer initiation and progression. Cancer cells are remarkably plastic which contributes to phenotypic and functional heterogeneity within tumours as well as resistance to targeted therapies. It is for these reasons that the scientific community has become increasingly interested in understanding the molecular mechanisms governing cancer cell plasticity. The purpose of this mini-review is to discuss different examples of cellular plasticity associated with metaplasia and epithelial-mesenchymal transition with a focus on therapy resistance.},

However, owing to the high variability in gene expression between individual cells, there is an inherent uncertainty in the precise temporal ordering of the cells. Pre-existing methods for pseudotime estimation have predominantly given point estimates precluding a rigorous analysis of the implications of uncertainty. We use probabilistic modelling techniques to quantify pseudotime uncertainty and propagate this into downstream differential expression analysis. We demonstrate that reliance on a point estimate of pseudotime can lead to inflated false discovery rates and that probabilistic approaches provide greater robustness and measures of the temporal resolution that can be obtained from pseudotime inference.},

We performed a systematic review of 26 manuscripts, published between 2014 and April 2015, that forecasted the West African Ebola outbreak while it was occurring, and we derived implications for how results could be interpreted by policymakers. Forecasted case counts varied widely. An important determinant of forecast accuracy for case counts was how far into the future predictions were made. Generally, forecasts for less than 2 months into the future tended to be more accurate than those made for more than 10 weeks into the future. The exceptions were parsimonious statistical models in which the decay of the rate of spread of the pathogen among susceptible individuals was dealt with explicitly. The most important lessons for policymakers regarding future outbreaks, when using similar modeling results, are: 1) uncertainty of forecasts will be greater in the beginning of the outbreak; 2) when data are limited, forecasts produced by models designed to inform specific decisions should be used complementarily for robust decision-making (e.g., 2 statistical models produced the most reliable case-counts forecasts for the studied Ebola outbreak but did not enable understanding of interventions' impact, whereas several compartmental models could estimate interventions' impact but required unavailable data); and 3) timely collection of essential data is necessary for optimal model use.},

The first documented cases occurred in primates over 45 years ago, but the amount of virus genetic diversity detected within bat populations, which have recently been identified as potential reservoir hosts, suggests that the filoviruses are much older. Here, detailed Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analyses are performed on 97 whole-genome sequences, 55 of which are newly reported, to comprehensively examine molecular evolutionary rates and estimate dates of common ancestry for viruses within the family Filoviridae. Molecular evolutionary rates for viruses belonging to different species range from 0.46 {\texttimes} 10-4 nucleotide substitutions/site/year for Sudan ebolavirus to 8.21 {\texttimes} 10-4 nucleotide substitutions/site/year for Reston ebolavirus. Most recent common ancestry can be traced back only within the last 50 years for Reston ebolavirus and Zaire ebolavirus species and suggests that viruses within these species may have undergone recent genetic bottlenecks. Viruses within Marburg marburgvirus and Sudan ebolavirus species can be traced back further and share most recent common ancestors approximately 700 and 850 years before the present, respectively. Examination of the whole family suggests that members of the Filoviridae, including the recently described Lloviu virus, shared a most recent common ancestor approximately 10,000 years ago. These data will be valuable for understanding the evolution of filoviruses in the context of natural history as new reservoir hosts are identified and, further, for determining mechanisms of emergence, pathogenicity, and the ongoing threat to public health.},

  abstract = {West Africa is currently witnessing the most extensive Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak so far recorded. Until now, there have been 27,013 reported cases and 11,134 deaths. The origin of the virus is thought to have been a zoonotic transmission from a bat to a two-year-old boy in December 2013 (ref. 2). From this index case the virus was spread by human-to-human contact throughout Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. However, the origin of the particular virus in each country and time of transmission is not known and currently relies on epidemiological analysis, which may be unreliable owing to the difficulties of obtaining patient information. Here we trace the genetic evolution of EBOV in the current outbreak that has resulted in multiple lineages. Deep sequencing of 179 patient samples processed by the European Mobile Laboratory, the first diagnostics unit to be deployed to the epicentre of the outbreak in Guinea, reveals an epidemiological and evolutionary history of the epidemic from March 2014 to January 2015. Analysis of EBOV genome evolution has also benefited from a similar sequencing effort of patient samples from Sierra Leone. Our results confirm that the EBOV from Guinea moved into Sierra Leone, most likely in April or early May. The viruses of the Guinea/Sierra Leone lineage mixed around June/July 2014. Viral sequences covering August, September and October 2014 indicate that this lineage evolved independently within Guinea. These data can be used in conjunction with epidemiological information to test retrospectively the effectiveness of control measures, and provides an unprecedented window into the evolution of an ongoing viral haemorrhagic fever outbreak.},

  abstract = {Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a significant and ever-increasing societal threat and burden. Activation of Lymphocyte antigen 6G6D could induce anti-tumor specific immunity unique to CRC, but factors regulating its activation remain obscure. Methods: Transcriptome, epigenome and proteomic data from TCGA and independent database were investigated using in silico approaches. Expression of candidate genes was independently validated by immunohistochemistry in CRC tissues. In vitro RNA mediated gene silencing of putative regulators, treatment with MEK and p38 MAPK inhibitors and Bioinformatic prediction were carried out to unveil LY6G6D regulation. Results: LY6G6D is down-regulated in mucinous CRC regardless its anatomic location, while its activation progresses through the classical adenoma-carcinoma sequence. The lack of LY6G6D expression in mucinous CRC involves alterations of secretome-based immune responses. DNA methylation changes in LY6G6D promoter are intimately related to its transcript regulation, epigenomic and different histological subtypes. RNA-mediated gene silencing and chemical inhibition of p38{$\alpha$} MAPK as well as DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 knock-down lead to a decrease in LY6G6D expression, supporting that p38a MAPK and DNA methylases mediated LY6G6D regulation. Cancer cells with an intact p38{$\alpha$} MAPK stabilize LY6G6D expression allowing effective responses to trametinib, a MEK inhibitor able to exert antiinflammatory effects. In a metastatic CRC subset, LY6G6D hypermethylation predicts resistance to FOLFOX first-line therapy, supporting the idea that its cancer-specific hypomethylation and consequent activation may be a tissue-specific mechanism of anti-tumor immunity. Conclusions: LY6G6D has the potentiality to be used as a biomarker for patient stratification and immune therapeutic intervention of mucinous versus non-mucinous CRC.},

However, various insults can lead to depletion of Lgr5 + stem cells, and colonic epithelium can be regenerated from Lgr5-negative cells. While studies in the small intestine have addressed the lineage identity of the Lgr5-negative regenerative cell population, in the colon this question has remained unanswered. Here, we set out to identify which cell(s) contribute to colonic regeneration by performing genetic fate-mapping studies of progenitor populations in mice. First, using keratin-19 (Krt19) to mark a heterogeneous population of cells, we found that Lgr5-negative cells can regenerate colonic crypts and give rise to Lgr5 + stem cells. Notch1 + absorptive progenitor cells did not contribute to epithelial repair after injury, whereas Atoh1 + secretory progenitors did contribute to this process. Additionally, while colonic Atoh1 + cells contributed minimally to other lineages during homeostasis, they displayed plasticity and contributed to epithelial repair during injury, independent of Lgr5 + cells. Our findings suggest that promotion of secretory progenitor plasticity could enable gut healing in colitis.},

  abstract = {Small mothers against decapentaplegic (SMAD) proteins are a family of signal transduction molecules in transforming growth factor {$\beta$} (TGF{$\beta$}) ligand pathways that have been found to have a key role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Long standing IBD predisposes individuals to colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC), an entity that possess unique characteristics compared to hereditary and sporadic cancer. The ligands of the TGF{$\beta$} super family along with SMADs have also been implicated in several aspects of colorectal cancer formation. SMAD proteins are shown to be involved in a number of potentially carcinogenic mechanisms such as altering gene transcription, controlling stem cell differentiation to causing epigenetic changes. Modulation of these proteins has emerged as a novel therapeutic intervention for IBD although its effect on carcinogenesis remains elusive. This account reviews available evidence linking SMAD proteins to CAC and explores the potential areas for future research in this area.},

  abstract = {Long-read sequencing has revolutionized genome assembly, yielding highly contiguous, chromosome-level contigs. However, assemblies from some third generation long read technologies, such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) Continuous Long Reads (CLR), have a high error rate. Such errors can be corrected with short reads through a process called polishing. Although best practices for polishing non-model de novo genome assemblies were recently described by the Vertebrate Genome Project (VGP) Assembly community, there is a need for a publicly available, reproducible workflow that can be easily implemented and run on a conventional high performance computing environment. Here, we describe polishCLR (https://github.com/isugifNF/polishCLR), a reproducible Nextflow workflow that implements best practices for polishing assemblies made from CLR data. PolishCLR can be initiated from several input options that extend best practices to suboptimal cases. It also provides re-entry points throughout several key processes including identifying duplicate haplotypes in purge\_dups, allowing a break for scaffolding if data are available, and throughout multiple rounds of polishing and evaluation with Arrow and FreeBayes. PolishCLR is containerized and publicly available for the greater assembly community as a tool to complete assemblies from existing, error-prone long-read data.},

  abstract = {Dimensionality reduction is standard practice for filtering noise and identifying relevant dimensions in large-scale data analyses. In biology, single-cell expression studies almost always begin with reduction to two or three dimensions to produce `all-in-one' visuals of the data that are amenable to the human eye, and these are subsequently used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of cell relationships. However, there is little theoretical support for this practice. We examine the theoretical and practical implications of low-dimensional embedding of single-cell data, and find extensive distortions incurred on the global and local properties of biological patterns relative to the highdimensional, ambient space. In lieu of this, we propose semi-supervised dimensionality reduction to higher dimension, and show that such targeted reduction guided by the metadata associated with single-cell experiments provides useful latent space representations for hypothesis-driven biological discovery.},

Once unbiased lists of genes or proteins are generated from such experiments, these lists are used as input for computing enrichment with existing lists created from prior knowledge organized into gene-set libraries. While many enrichment analysis tools and gene-set libraries databases have been developed, there is still room for improvement. RESULTS: Here, we present Enrichr, an integrative web-based and mobile software application that includes new gene-set libraries, an alternative approach to rank enriched terms, and various interactive visualization approaches to display enrichment results using the JavaScript library, Data Driven Documents (D3). The software can also be embedded into any tool that performs gene list analysis. We applied Enrichr to analyze nine cancer cell lines by comparing their enrichment signatures to the enrichment signatures of matched normal tissues. We observed a common pattern of up regulation of the polycomb group PRC2 and enrichment for the histone mark H3K27me3 in many cancer cell lines, as well as alterations in Toll-like receptor and interlukin signaling in K562 cells when compared with normal myeloid CD33+ cells. Such analyses provide global visualization of critical differences between normal tissues and cancer cell lines but can be applied to many other scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Enrichr is an easy to use intuitive enrichment analysis web-based tool providing various types of visualization summaries of collective functions of gene lists.

However, existing algorithms either collapse heterozygous alleles into one consensus copy or fail to cleanly separate the haplotypes to produce high-quality phased assemblies. Here we describe hifiasm, a de novo assembler that takes advantage of long high-fidelity sequence reads to faithfully represent the haplotype information in a phased assembly graph. Unlike other graph-based assemblers that only aim to maintain the contiguity of one haplotype, hifiasm strives to preserve the contiguity of all haplotypes. This feature enables the development of a graph trio binning algorithm that greatly advances over standard trio binning. On three human and five nonhuman datasets, including California redwood with a {\textasciitilde}30-Gb hexaploid genome, we show that hifiasm frequently delivers better assemblies than existing tools and consistently outperforms others on haplotype-resolved assembly.},

  abstract = {The previous articles of this series provided presumptive evidence that the four main differentiated cell types in the epithelium of the mouse small intestine: villus columnar, mucous, entero-endocrine, and Paneth cells, originate from the same precursor, the crypt-base columnar cell. In the present work, direct evidence was obtained in support of this view. It was first found that crypt-base columnar cells phagocytose non-viable cells in their vicinity, with the result that a large phagosome appears in the cytoplasm. Such phagosomes were then used as markers to follow the evolution of crypt-base columnar cells. In normal control animals, a rare crypt-base columnar cell includes a large phagosome containing Paneth cell remnants. By six hours after injection of two {$\mu$}Ci 3H-thymidine per g body weight, a fair number of crypt-base columnar cells include a different type of phagosome containing labeled nucleus and granulefree cytoplasm, which is attributed to phagocytosis of a labeled crypt-base columnar cell killed by beta-radiation from the incorporated 3H-thymidine. By 12 hours after 3H-thymidine injection, phagosomes have appeared in partly differentiated mid-crypt columnar cells and oligomucous cells; by 18{\textendash}24 hours, in fully differentiated columnar cells and in Paneth cells; and by 30 hours, in an entero-endocrine cell. Since phagosomes are first found in crypt-base columnar cells and only later in the four differentiated cell types, it is concluded that crypt-base columnar cells transform into cells of these four types and, therefore, behave as the stem cells of the epithelium. The finding of rare epithelial cells containing two different types of secretory material (either mucous globules and entero-endocrine granules, or mucous globules and Paneth cell granules) confirms that the stem cells are multipotential. These findings support the Unitarian Theory of epithelial cell formation in the small intestine.},

  abstract = {Although the Hippo transcriptional coactivator YAP is considered oncogenic in many tissues, its roles in intestinal homeostasis and colorectal cancer (CRC) remain controversial. Here, we demonstrate that the Hippo kinases LATS1/2 and MST1/2, which inhibit YAP activity, are required for maintaining Wnt signaling and canonical stem cell function. Hippo inhibition induces a distinct epithelial cell state marked by low Wnt signaling, a wound-healing response, and transcription factor Klf6 expression. Notably, loss of LATS1/2 or overexpression of YAP is sufficient to reprogram Lgr5+ cancer stem cells to this state and thereby suppress tumor growth in organoids, patient-derived xenografts, and mouse models of primary and metastatic CRC. Finally, we demonstrate that genetic deletion of YAP and its paralog TAZ promotes the growth of these tumors. Collectively, our results establish the role of YAP as a tumor suppressor in the adult colon and implicate Hippo kinases as therapeutic vulnerabilities in colorectal malignancies.},

  abstract = {Recent ChIP experiments of human and mouse embryonic stem cells have elucidated the architecture of the transcriptional regulatory circuitry responsible for cell determination, which involves the transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG. In addition to regulating each other through feedback loops, these genes also regulate downstream target genes involved in the maintenance and differentiation of embryonic stem cells. A search for the OCT4{\textendash}SOX2{\textendash}NANOG network motif in other species reveals that it is unique to mammals. With a kinetic modeling approach, we ascribe function to the observed OCT4{\textendash}SOX2{\textendash}NANOG network by making plausible assumptions about the interactions between the transcription factors at the gene promoter binding sites and RNA polymerase (RNAP), at each of the three genes as well as at the target genes. We identify a bistable switch in the network, which arises due to several positive feedback loops, and is switched on/off by input environmental signals. The switch stabilizes the expression levels of the three genes, and through their regulatory roles on the downstream target genes, leads to a binary decision: when OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG are expressed and the switch is on, the self-renewal genes are on and the differentiation genes are off. The opposite holds when the switch is off. The model is extremely robust to parameter changes. In addition to providing a self-consistent picture of the transcriptional circuit, the model generates several predictions. Increasing the binding strength of NANOG to OCT4 and SOX2, or increasing its basal transcriptional rate, leads to an irreversible bistable switch: the switch remains on even when the activating signal is removed. Hence, the stem cell can be manipulated to be self-renewing without the requirement of input signals. We also suggest tests that could discriminate between a variety of feedforward regulation architectures of the target genes by OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG.},

In order to keep up with daily demands, the intestine has evolved a mechanism to expand the absorptive surface area by undergoing a morphogenetic process to generate finger-like units called villi. These villi house specialized cell types critical for both absorbing nutrients from food, and for protecting the host from commensal and pathogenic microbes present in the adult gut. In this review, we will discuss mechanisms that coordinate intestinal development, growth, and maturation of the small intestine, starting from the formation of the early gut tube, through villus morphogenesis and into early postnatal life when the intestine must adapt to the acquisition of nutrients through food intake, and to interactions with microbes.},

The median duration of disease to the diagnosis of cancer was long (CD 15 years; UC 18 years). Most cancers developed after more than eight years of disease (CD 75\%; UC 90\%). Patients with multiple carcinomas at diagnosis were equally common (CD 11\%; UC 12\%). Carcinoma occurred in the area of macroscopic disease in most patients (CD 85\%; UC 100\%). Mucinous and signet ring histological features were equally common (CD 29\%; UC 21\%). Dysplasia was present with similar frequency in both diseases (CD 73\%; UC 79\%). The overall five year survival rates were also similar (CD 46\%; UC 50\%). These findings show that carcinomas complicating CD and UC have strikingly similar clinicopathological features and suggest that a common underlying process, such as chronic inflammation, maybe important in the pathogenesis of colorectal carcinoma.},

Using epidemic modeling and data from two well-documented Ebola outbreaks (Congo 1995 and Uganda 2000), we estimate the number of secondary cases generated by an index case in the absence of control interventions (R0). Our estimate of R0 is 1.83 (sd 0.06) for Congo (1995) and 1.34 (sd 0.03) for Uganda (2000). We model the course of the outbreaks via an SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) epidemic model that includes a smooth transition in the transmission rate after control interventions are put in place. We perform an uncertainty analysis of the basic reproductive number R0 to quantify its sensitivity to other disease-related parameters. We also analyse the sensitivity of the final epidemic size to the time interventions begin and provide a distribution for the final epidemic size. The control measures implemented during these two outbreaks (including education and contact tracing followed by quarantine) reduce the final epidemic size by a factor of 2 relative the final size with a 2-week delay in their implementation.},

P14ARF protein quenches oncogene stimuli by inhibiting cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis. P14ARF functions can be played through interactions with several proteins. However, the majority of its activities are notoriously mediated by the p53 protein. Interestingly, recent studies suggest a new role of p14ARF in the maintenance of chromosome stability. Here, we deepened this new facet of p14ARF which we believe is relevant to its tumor suppressive role in the cell. To this aim, we generated a monoclonal HCT116 cell line expressing the p14ARF cDNA cloned in the piggyback vector and then induced aneuploidy by treating HCT116 cells with the CENP-E inhibitor GSK923295. P14ARF ectopic re-expression restored the near-diploid phenotype of HCT116 cells, confirming that p14ARF counteracts aneuploid cell generation/proliferation.},

The expression of Wnt-signaling proteins and p53 during colitis-associated carcinogenesis was determined.,  Methods: A tissue microarray was constructed with colonic samples from 5 groups of patients: controls (C, n=10), IBD without neoplasia (IBD, n=12), non-dysplastic IBD with neoplasia elsewhere in the colon (IBD-NE, n=12), dysplastic lesion in IBD (IBD-DYS, n=12), and IBD-associated colorectal cancer (IBD-CRC, n=10). Immunohistochemistry was performed for {$\beta$}-catenin, cyclin D1 and p53. p53 sequence analysis was performed in some cases.,  Results: Nuclear {$\beta$}-catenin expression was found in 0\%, 0\%, 50\%, 55\% and 100\% of the patients in the C-, IBD-, IBD-NE-, IBD-DYS- and IBD-CRC-groups, respectively. Non-dysplastic IBD mucosa with neoplasia detected elsewhere showed nuclear expression in 50\% of the cases compared to 0\% in IBD mucosa without neoplasia (p=0.02). Cyclin D1 staining had similar expression patterns. Overexpression of p53 was only detected in the IBD-DYS (66.7\%) and IBD-CRC groups (50\%).,  Conclusion: In contrast to previous findings, our results suggest activation of the Wnt-pathway in the early phase of colitis-associated carcinogenesis. Furthermore, as Wnt activation was observed in 50\% of the IBD-NE cases, nuclear {$\beta$}-catenin may facilitate detection of neoplasia.},

  abstract = {The tumor suppressor p53 is frequently mutated in human cancer. Common mutant p53 (mutp53) isoforms can actively promote cancer through gain-of-function (GOF) mechanisms. We report that mutp53 prolongs TNF-{$\alpha$}-induced NF-{$\kappa$}B activation in cultured cells and intestinal organoid cultures. Remarkably, when exposed to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), mice harboring a germline p53 mutation develop severe chronic inflammation and persistent tissue damage, and are highly prone to inflammation-associated colon cancer. This mutp53 GOF is manifested by rapid onset of flat dysplastic lesions that progress to invasive carcinoma with mutp53 accumulation and augmented NF-{$\kappa$}B activation, faithfully recapitulating features frequently observed in human colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). These findings might explain the early appearance of p53 mutations in human CAC.},

  abstract = {Background Dysregulation of transcriptional programs leads to cell malfunctioning and can have an impact in cancer development. Our study aims to characterize global differences between transcriptional regulatory programs of normal and tumor cells of the colon. Methods Affymetrix Human Genome U219 expression arrays were used to assess gene expression in 100 samples of colon tumor and their paired adjacent normal mucosa. Transcriptional networks were reconstructed using ARACNe algorithm using 1,000 bootstrap replicates consolidated into a consensus network. Networks were compared regarding topology parameters and identified well-connected clusters. Functional enrichment was performed with SIGORA method. ENCODE ChIP-Seq data curated in the hmChIP database was used for in silico validation of the most prominent transcription factors. Results The normal network contained 1,177 transcription factors, 5,466 target genes and 61,226 transcriptional interactions. A large loss of transcriptional interactions in the tumor network was observed (11,585; 81\% reduction), which also contained fewer transcription factors (621; 47\% reduction) and target genes (2,190; 60\% reduction) than the normal network. Gene silencing was not a main determinant of this loss of regulatory activity, since the average gene expression was essentially conserved. Also, 91 transcription factors increased their connectivity in the tumor network. These genes revealed a tumor-specific emergent transcriptional regulatory program with significant functional enrichment related to colorectal cancer pathway. In addition, the analysis of clusters again identified subnetworks in the tumors enriched for cancer related pathways (immune response, Wnt signaling, DNA replication, cell adherence, apoptosis, DNA repair, among others). Also multiple metabolism pathways show differential clustering between the tumor and normal network. Conclusions These findings will allow a better understanding of the transcriptional regulatory programs altered in colon cancer and could be an invaluable methodology to identify potential hubs with a relevant role in the field of cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapy.

  abstract = {Epigenetic regulators are recurrently mutated and aberrantly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Targeted therapies designed to inhibit these chromatin-modifying enzymes, such as the histone demethylase lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) and the histone methyltransferase DOT1L, have been developed as novel treatment modalities for these often refractory diseases. A common feature of many of these targeted agents is their ability to induce myeloid differentiation, suggesting that multiple paths toward a myeloid gene expression program can be engaged to relieve the differentiation blockade that is uniformly seen in AML. We performed a comparative assessment of chromatin dynamics during the treatment of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-AF9-driven murine leukemias and MLL-rearranged patient-derived xenografts using 2 distinct but effective differentiation-inducing targeted epigenetic therapies, the LSD1 inhibitor GSK-LSD1 and the DOT1L inhibitor EPZ4777. Intriguingly, GSK-LSD1 treatment caused global gains in chromatin accessibility, whereas treatment with EPZ4777 caused global losses in accessibility. We captured PU.1 and C/EBP{$\alpha$} motif signatures at LSD1 inhibitor-induced dynamic sites and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing revealed co-occupancy of these myeloid transcription factors at these sites. Functionally, we confirmed that diminished expression of PU.1 or genetic deletion of C/EBP{$\alpha$} in MLL-AF9 cells generates resistance of these leukemias to LSD1 inhibition. These findings reveal that pharmacologic inhibition of LSD1 represents a unique path to overcome the differentiation block in AML for therapeutic benefit.},

  abstract = {The intestinal epithelium is a complex system characterized by massive and continuous cell renewal and differentiation. In this context, cell-type-specific transcription factors are thought to play a crucial role by modulating specific transcription networks and signalling pathways. Hnf1alpha and beta are closely related atypical homeoprotein transcription factors expressed in several epithelia, including the gut. With the use of a conditional inactivation system, we generated mice in which Hnf1b is specifically inactivated in the intestinal epithelium on a wild-type or Hnf1a(-/-) genetic background. Whereas the inactivation of Hnf1a or Hnf1b alone did not lead to any major intestinal dysfunction, the concomitant inactivation of both genes resulted in a lethal phenotype. Double-mutant animals had defective differentiation and cell fate commitment. The expression levels of markers of all the differentiated cell types, both enterocytes and secretory cells, were affected. In addition, the number of goblet cells was increased, whereas mature Paneth cells were missing. At the molecular level, we show that Hnf1alpha and beta act upstream of the Notch pathway controlling directly the expression of two crucial components: Jag1 and Atoh1. We demonstrate that the double-mutant mice present with a defect in intestinal water absorption and that Hnf1alpha and beta directly control the expression of Slc26a3, a gene whose mutations are associated with chloride diarrhoea in human patients. Our study identifies new direct target genes of the Hnf1 transcription factors and shows that they play crucial roles in both defining cell fate and controlling terminal functions in the gut epithelium.},

We prepared an R Bioconductor compatible package to detect, characterize and remove such probes in Affymetrix 3'IVT and exon-based arrays on the basis of correlation of signal intensities from probes within probe sets. Results Using completely mouse genomes we determined type 1 (false negatives) and type 2 (false positives) errors with high accuracy and we show that our method routinely outperforms previous methods. When detecting 76.2\% of known SNP/indels in mouse expression data, we obtain at most 5.5\% false positives. At the same level of false positives, best previous method detected 72.6\%. We also show that probes with differing binding affinity both hinder differential expression detection and introduce artifacts in cancer-healthy tissue comparison.

  abstract = {The human Ink4a/Arf tumor suppressor locus encodes two distinct products: p16Ink4a which prevents phosphorylation and inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein and, p14Arf, a nucleolar protein which activates the function of the tumor suppressor p53 protein in the nucleoplasm in response to oncogenic stimulation through an as yet ill-defined mechanism. Here we show that the level of endogenous p14Arf and its balance between the nucleolus and the nucleoplasm in HeLa cells are exquisitely sensitive to changes in cell morphology and to short-lived perturbations in cell cycle and in nucleolar function such as those induced by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, roscovitine, and the casein kinase II and RNA synthesis inhibitor, DRB. Most remarkably, whereas p14Arf predominantly concentrates in the nucleolus of interphase cells and transiently disappears between metaphase and early G1 under normal growth conditions, it massively and reversibly accumulates in the nucleoplasm of postmitotic and S-phase cells upon short-term treatment with roscovitine and, at a lesser extent, DRB. In line with the fact that the nuclear level of p53 reaches a peak between mid-G1 and the G1/S border in p53-expressor cells which lack Arf expression, these results provide a clue that, in p53+/Arf+ cells, Arf proteins might serve both to speed and to amplify p53-mediated responses in conditions and cell cycle periods in which the mechanisms involved in p53 stabilization and activation are not fully operational. They further suggest that human endogenous p14Arf might activate p53 pathways in physiologic situations by acting inside the nucleoplasm, especially when normal cell cycle progression and nucleolar function are compromised.},

Lgr5-LacZ and Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-creERT2 mice were fed diets enriched with n-3 PUFA vs n-6 PUFA (control) and exposed to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) for 5 days in order to induce crypt damage and colitis throughout the colon. Stem cell number, cell proliferation, apoptosis, expression of stem cell (Lgr5, Sox9, Bmi1, Hopx, mTert, Ascl2, and DCAMKL-1) and inflammation (STAT3) markers were quantified. DSS treatment resulted in the ablation of Lgr5+ stem cells in the distal colon, concurrent with the loss of distal crypt structure and proliferating cells. Lgr5, Ascl2 and Hopx mRNA expression levels were decreased in damaged colonic mucosa. Lgr5+ stem cells reappeared at day 5 of DSS recovery, with normal levels attained by day 6 of recovery. There was no effect of diet on the recovery of stem cells. FO fed animals exhibited higher levels of phospho-STAT3 at all time points, consistent with a higher wounding by DSS in FO feeding. n-3 PUFA-fed mice exhibited a reduction in stem cell associated factors, Ascl2, Axin2 and EphB3. These results indicate that rapidly cycling Lgr5+ stem cells residing at position 1 in the colon epithelium are highly susceptible to DSS-induced damage and that dietary cues can impact stem cell regulatory networks.},

This process is often driven through aberrant activation of Wnt signaling by mutations in components acting downstream of the receptor complex that unfetter tumor cells from the need for Wnts. Here we describe a class of colon cancer that does not depend on mutated core components of the Wnt pathway. Genetically blocking Wnt secretion from epithelial cells of such tumors results in apoptosis, reduced expression of colon cancer markers, followed by enhanced tumor differentiation. In contrast to the normal colonic epithelium, such tumor cells autosecrete Wnts to maintain their uncontrolled proliferative behavior. In humans, we determined certain cases of colon cancers in which the Wnt pathway is hyperactive, but not through mutations in its core components. Our findings illuminate the path in therapy to find further subtypes of Wnt-dependent colon cancer that might be responsive to Wnt secretion inhibitors.},

Here, we address this issue using a collection of phylodynamic approaches. We show that long-distance dispersal events were not crucial for epidemic expansion and that preventing viral lineage movement to any given administrative area would, in most cases, have had little impact. However, major urban areas were critical in attracting and disseminating the virus: preventing viral lineage movement to all three capitals simultaneously would have contained epidemic size to one-third. We also show that announcements of border closures were followed by a significant but transient effect on international virus dispersal. By quantifying the hypothetical impact of different intervention strategies, as well as the impact of barriers on dispersal frequency, our study illustrates how phylodynamic analyses can help to address specific epidemiological and outbreak control questions.},

  abstract = {Rabies is an important zoonotic disease distributed worldwide. A key question in rabies epidemiology is the identification of factors that impact virus dispersion. Here we apply new analytical methods, based on phylogeographic reconstructions of viral lineage movement, to undertake a comparative evolutionary-epidemiological study of the spatial dynamics of rabies virus (RABV) epidemics in different hosts and habitats. We compiled RABV data sets from skunk, raccoon, bat and domestic dog populations in order to investigate the viral diffusivity of different RABV epidemics, and to detect and compare the environmental factors that impact the velocity of viral spread in continuous spatial landscapes. We build on a recently developed statistical framework that uses spatially- and temporally-referenced phylogenies. We estimate several spatial statistics of virus spread, which reveal a higher diffusivity of RABV in domestic dogs compared with RABV in other mammals. This finding is explained by subsequent analyses of environmental heterogeneity, which indicate that factors relating to human geography play a significant role in RABV dispersion in domestic dogs. More generally, our results suggest that human-related factors are important worldwide in explaining RABV dispersion in terrestrial host species. Our study shows that phylogenetically informed viral movements can be used to elucidate the factors that impact virus dispersal, opening new opportunities for a better understanding of the impact of host species and environmental conditions on the spatial dynamics of rapidly evolving populations.},

  abstract = {Illumina sequencing allows rapid, cheap and accurate whole genome bacterial analyses, but short reads (\&lt;300\,bp) do not usually enable complete genome assembly. Long-read sequencing greatly assists with resolving complex bacterial genomes, particularly when combined with short-read Illumina data (hybrid assembly). However, it is not clear how different long-read sequencing methods affect hybrid assembly accuracy. Relative automation of the assembly process is also crucial to facilitating high-throughput complete bacterial genome reconstruction, avoiding multiple bespoke filtering and data manipulation steps. In this study, we compared hybrid assemblies for 20 bacterial isolates, including two reference strains, using Illumina sequencing and long reads from either Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) or SMRT Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencing platforms. We chose isolates from the family Enterobacteriaceae, as these frequently have highly plastic, repetitive genetic structures, and complete genome reconstruction for these species is relevant for a precise understanding of the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance. We de novo assembled genomes using the hybrid assembler Unicycler and compared different read processing strategies, as well as comparing to long-read-only assembly with Flye followed by short-read polishing with Pilon. Hybrid assembly with either PacBio or ONT reads facilitated high-quality genome reconstruction, and was superior to the long-read assembly and polishing approach evaluated with respect to accuracy and completeness. Combining ONT and Illumina reads fully resolved most genomes without additional manual steps, and at a lower consumables cost per isolate in our setting. Automated hybrid assembly is a powerful tool for complete and accurate bacterial genome assembly.,},

  abstract = {The Hippo pathway and its downstream effectors, the transcriptional coactivators Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), control stem cell fate and cell proliferation and differentiation and are essential for tissue self-renewal and regeneration. YAP/TAZ are the core components of the Hippo pathway and they coregulate transcription when localized in the nucleus. The intestinal epithelium undergoes well-regulated self-renewal and regeneration programs to maintain the structural and functional integrity of the epithelial barrier. This prevents luminal pathogen attack, and facilitates daily nutrient absorption and immune balance. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic relapsing inflammation of the entire digestive tract. Impaired mucosal healing is a prominent biological feature of IBD. Intestinal self-renewal is primarily dependent on functional intestinal stem cells (ISCs), especially Lgr5+ crypt base columnar (CBC) cells and transient-amplifying (TA) cells in the crypt base. However, intestinal wound healing is a complicated process that is often associated with epithelial cells, and mesenchymal and immune cells in the mucosal microenvironment. Upon intestinal injury, nonproliferative cells rapidly migrate towards the wound bed to reseal the damaged epithelium, which is followed by cell proliferation and differentiation. YAP is generally localized in the nucleus of Lgr5+ CBC cells, where it transcriptionally regulates the expression of the ISC marker Lgr5 and plays an important role in intestinal self-renewal. YAP/TAZ are the primary mechanical sensors of the cellular microenvironment. Their functions include expanding progenitor and stem cell populations, reprogramming differentiated cells into a primitive state, and mediating the regenerative function of reserve stem cells. Thus, YAP/TAZ play extremely crucial roles in epithelial repair after damage. This review provides an overview of the Hippo{\textendash}YAP/TAZ signaling pathway and the processes of intestinal self-renewal and regeneration. In particular, we summarize the roles of YAP/TAZ in the phases of intestinal self-renewal and regeneration to suggest a potential strategy for IBD treatment.},

  abstract = {The liver possesses a remarkable regenerative capacity based partly on the ability of hepatocytes to re-enter the cell cycle and divide to replace damaged cells. This capability is substantially reduced upon chronic damage, but it is not clear if this is a cause or consequence of liver disease. Here, we investigate whether blocking hepatocyte division using two different mouse models affects physiology as well as clinical liver manifestations like fibrosis and inflammation. We find that in P14 Cdk1Liv-/- mice, where the division of hepatocytes is abolished, polyploidy, DNA damage, and increased p53 signaling are prevalent. Cdk1Liv-/- mice display classical markers of liver damage two weeks after birth, including elevated ALT, ALP, and bilirubin levels, despite the lack of exogenous liver injury. Inflammation was further studied using cytokine arrays, unveiling elevated levels of CCL2, TIMP1, CXCL10, and IL1-Rn in Cdk1Liv-/- liver, which resulted in increased numbers of monocytes. Ablation of CDK2-dependent DNA re-replication and polyploidy in Cdk1Liv-/- mice reversed most of these phenotypes. Overall, our data indicate that blocking hepatocyte division induces biological processes driving the onset of the disease phenotype. It suggests that the decrease in hepatocyte division observed in liver disease may not only be a consequence of fibrosis and inflammation, but also a pathological cue.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: WNT signaling pathway dysregulation is an important event in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC) with APC mutations seen in more than 80\% of sporadic CRC. However, such mutations in the WNT signaling pathway genes are rare in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) associated neoplasia (dysplasia and cancer). This study examined the role of epigenetic silencing of WNT signaling pathway genes in the pathogenesis of IBD-associated neoplasia. METHODS: Paraffin-embedded tissue samples were obtained and methylation of ten WNT signaling pathway genes, including APC1A, APC2, SFRP1, SFRP2, SFRP4, SFRP5, DKK1, DKK3, WIF1 and LKB1, was analyzed. Methylation analysis was performed on 41 IBD samples, 27 normal colon samples (NCs), and 24 sporadic CRC samples. RESULTS: Methylation of WNT signaling pathway genes is a frequent and early event in IBD and IBD-associated neoplasia. A progressive increase in the percentage of methylated genes in the WNT signaling pathway from NCs (4.2\%) to IBD colitis (39.7\%) to IBD-associated neoplasia (63.4\%) was seen (NCs vs. IBD colitis, p {$<$} 0.01; IBD colitis vs. IBD-associated neoplasia, p = 0.01). In the univariate logistic regression model, methylation of APC2 (OR 4.7, 95\% CI: 1.1-20.63, p = 0.04), SFRP1 (OR 5.1, 95\% CI: 1.1-31.9, p = 0.04), and SFRP2 (OR 5.1, 95\% CI: 1.1-32.3, p = 0.04) was associated with progression from IBD colitis to IBD-associated neoplasia, while APC1A methylation was borderline significant (OR 4.1, 95\% CI: 0.95-17.5, p = 0.06). In the multivariate logistic regression model, methylation of APC1A and APC2 was more likely to be associated with IBD-associated neoplasia than IBD colitis. (OR APC1A: 6.4, 95\% CI: 1.1-37.7 p = 0.04; OR APC2 9.1, 95\% CI: 1.3-61.7, p = 0.02). SUMMARY: Methylation of the WNT signaling genes is an early event seen in patients with IBD colitis and there is a progressive increase in methylation of the WNT signaling genes during development of IBD-associated neoplasia. Moreover, methylation of APC1A, APC2, SFRP1, and SFRP2 appears to mark progression from IBD colitis to IBD-associated neoplasia, and these genes may serve as biomarkers for IBD-associated neoplasia.},

IX regeneration studies are of critical importance from environmental perspectives. Specifically, the knowledge is essential for water utilities who presently operate IX (for PFAS removal) in a single use-and-dispose mode. In this study, legacy PFAS such as PFOA/PFOS were tested along with other harmful short-chained PFAS (PFBA/PFBS) and other toxic perfluorinated substitutes (GenX). Studies were performed on synthetic water (spiked with Suwannee River Natural Organic Matter (SRNOM), Fulvic Acid (SRFA) and Humic Acid (SRHA)), surface water, and wastewater effluents, and the regeneration was performed in batch stirred reactors. The resin service life with and without regeneration was investigated in the presence of background organic matter. In ultra-pure waters, all PFAS (C0 {$\sim$}10~{$\mu$}g/L, concentrations similar to that of natural waters) were effectively removed for {$>$}100,000 Bed Volume (BV) of operation. This was reduced to {$\sim$}23,500 BV in the presence of SRNOM (C0~=~5~mg~C/L), 20,500 BV in SRFA and 8500 BV in SRHA, after which the saturated resins required regeneration. More importantly, all resin breakthrough (PFAS{$>$} 70~ng/L) corresponded to~{$>~$}90\% resin site saturation (in meqs), an essential information for optimizing IX loading. The competitive dissolved organic matter (DOM) fractions were estimated to be approximately 5{\textendash}9\% of the initial DOC, as estimated by the IAST-EBC model. Finally, it was identified that IX regeneration efficiency improved with increasing brine contact time but effectiveness plateaued for brine concentrations above 10\% (W/V). Nonetheless, a regeneration with 10\% NaCl solution with a contact time of 2~h was found to be optimal for IX operations in synthetic and natural waters. Therefore, this study provides key knowledge essential for the scientific community and the water industry on optimizing IX operational parameters for DOM and PFAS removal and would be highly valuable for systems which presently operate IX in a use-and-dispose mode.},

Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large ({$>$}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {$>$}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 {\texttimes} 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.

Here we discuss problems related to the sensitivity, accuracy, specificity and reproducibility of microarray results. The existing data suggest that for relatively abundant transcripts the existence and direction (but not the magnitude) of expression changes can be reliably detected. However, accurate measurements of absolute expression levels and the reliable detection of low abundance genes are difficult to achieve. The main problems seem to be the sub-optimal design or choice of probes and some incorrect probe annotations. Well-designed data-analysis approaches can rectify some of these problems.},

  abstract = {Current treatments for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) target the overactive immune response of the intestinal mucosa. However, epidermal growth factor (EGF), an activating ligand of the EGF receptor (EGFR), has been shown to induce disease remission through direct targeting of intestinal mucosal healing. Despite promising preclinical and clinical results, this EGFR-activating therapy has not progressed, in part due to the potential for carcinogenesis associated with long-term use and the increased risk of colitis-associated cancer (CAC) in IBD. Here we tested whether pharmacological modulation of EGFR altered outcomes of CAC in the murine azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium model. We found that administering EGF during the period of maximum colitis severity (``early''), coincident with the initiation and early promotion of tumors, improved outcomes of colitis and reduced tumor size. In contrast, daily EGF administration beginning {\textasciitilde}2 months after tumor initiation (``late'') increased tumor size. Administration of the EGFR kinase inhibitor gefitinib increased the tumor size when the drug was given early and decreased the tumor size when the drug was administered late. EGF administration not only reduced colonic cytokine and chemokine expression during injury, but also baseline chemokine expression in homeostasis. These results suggest that EGFR activation during acute bouts of colitis may reduce the long-term burden of CAC.},

  abstract = {The intestinal tract is lined by a single layer of epithelium that is one of the fastest regenerating tissues in the body and which therefore requires a very active and exquisitely controlled stem cell population. Rapid renewal of the epithelium is necessary to provide a continuous physical barrier from the intestinal luminal microenvironment that contains abundant microorganisms, whilst also ensuring an efficient surface for the absorption of dietary components. Specialised epithelial cell populations are important for the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and are derived from adult intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Actively cycling ISCs divide by a neutral drift mechanism yielding either ISCs or transit-amplifying epithelial cells, the latter of which differentiate to become either absorptive lineages or to produce secretory factors that contribute further to intestinal barrier maintenance or signal to other cellular compartments. The mechanisms controlling ISC abundance, longevity and activity are regulated by several different cell populations and signalling pathways in the intestinal lamina propria which together form the ISC niche. However, the complexity of the ISC niche and communication mechanisms between its different components are only now starting to be unravelled with the assistance of intestinal organoid/enteroid/colonoid and single-cell imaging and sequencing technologies. This review explores the interaction between well-established and emerging ISC niche components, their impact on the intestinal epithelium in health and in the context of intestinal injury and highlights future directions and implications for this rapidly developing field.},

The epidemiology of the virus remains poorly understood, and while case-based and seroepidemiological studies have been employed extensively throughout the epidemic, viral sequence data have not been utilised to their full potential. Here, we use existing MERS-CoV sequence data to explore its phylodynamics in two of its known major hosts, humans and camels. We employ structured coalescent models to show that long-term MERS-CoV evolution occurs exclusively in camels, whereas humans act as a transient, and ultimately terminal host. By analysing the distribution of human outbreak cluster sizes and zoonotic introduction times, we show that human outbreaks in the Arabian peninsula are driven by seasonally varying zoonotic transfer of viruses from camels. Without heretofore unseen evolution of host tropism, MERS-CoV is unlikely to become endemic in humans.},

Here we reconstruct the dispersal, proliferation and decline of Ebola virus throughout the region by analysing 1,610 Ebola virus genomes, which represent over 5\% of the known cases. We test the association of geography, climate and demography with viral movement among administrative regions, inferring a classic `gravity' model, with intense dispersal between larger and closer populations. Despite attenuation of international dispersal after border closures, cross-border transmission had already sown the seeds for an international epidemic, rendering these measures ineffective at curbing the epidemic. We address why the epidemic did not spread into neighbouring countries, showing that these countries were susceptible to substantial outbreaks but at lower risk of introductions. Finally, we reveal that this large epidemic was a heterogeneous and spatially dissociated collection of transmission clusters of varying size, duration and connectivity. These insights will help to inform interventions in future epidemics.},

  abstract = {Background \& Aims Aspirin reduces colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality. Understanding the biology responsible for this protective effect is key to developing biomarker-led approaches for rational clinical use. Wnt signaling drives CRC development from initiation to progression through regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell populations. Here, we investigated whether aspirin can rescue these proinvasive phenotypes associated with CRC progression in Wnt-driven human and mouse intestinal organoids. Methods We evaluated aspirin-mediated effects on phenotype and stem cell markers in intestinal organoids derived from mouse (ApcMin/+ and Apcflox/flox) and human familial adenomatous polyposis patients. CRC cell lines (HCT116 and Colo205) were used to study effects on motility, invasion, Wnt signaling, and EMT. Results Aspirin rescues the Wnt-driven cystic organoid phenotype by promoting budding in mouse and human Apc deficient organoids, which is paralleled by decreased stem cell marker expression. Aspirin-mediated Wnt inhibition in ApcMin/+ mice is associated with EMT inhibition and decreased cell migration, invasion, and motility in CRC cell lines. Chemical Wnt activation induces EMT and stem-like alterations in CRC cells, which are rescued by aspirin. Aspirin increases expression of the Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 in CRC cells and organoids derived from familial adenomatous polyposis patients, which contributes to EMT and cancer stem cell inhibition. Conclusions We provide evidence of phenotypic biomarkers of response to aspirin with an increased epithelial and reduced stem-like state mediated by an increase in Dickkopf-1. This highlights a novel mechanism of aspirin-mediated Wnt inhibition and potential phenotypic and molecular biomarkers for trials.},

  abstract = {The role of the basement membrane is vital in maintaining the integrity and structure of an epithelial layer, acting as both a mechanical support and forming the physical interface between epithelial cells and the surrounding connective tissue. The function of this membrane is explored here in the context of the epithelial monolayer that lines the colonic crypt, test-tube shaped invaginations that punctuate the lining of the intestine and coordinate a regular turnover of cells to replenish the epithelial layer every few days. To investigate the consequence of genetic mutations that perturb the system dynamics and can lead to colorectal cancer, it must be possible to track the emerging tissue level changes that arise in the crypt. To that end, a theoretical crypt model with a realistic, deformable geometry is required. A new discrete crypt model is presented, which focuses on the interaction between cell- and tissue-level behaviour, while incorporating key subcellular components. The model contains a novel description of the role of the surrounding tissue and musculature, based upon experimental observations of the tissue structure of the crypt, which are also reported. A two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional geometry is considered, and the shape of the crypt is allowed to evolve and deform. Simulation results reveal how the shape of the crypt may contribute mechanically to the asymmetric division events typically associated with the stem cells at the base. The model predicts that epithelial cell migration may arise due to feedback between cell loss at the crypt collar and density-dependent cell division, an hypothesis which can be investigated in a wet lab. This work forms the basis for investigation of the deformation of the crypt structure that can occur due to proliferation of cells exhibiting mutant phenotypes, experiments that would not be possible in vivo or in vitro.},

Ubiquitin is one of the most conserved proteins yet identified, and up until now it has been thought to be present only in eukaryotes and archaebacteria. This is the first report on the detection and purification of ubiquitin from a eubacterium, the cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis. The purification procedure included a heat denaturing step, fractionated ammonium sulfate precipitation, two gel filtration runs (Sephadex G-50 and Superose 12), and a final hydroxylapatite chromatography. Comparisons with bovine ubiquitin showed a high similarity with respect to antigenicity to anti-ubiquitin (bovine), molecular mass (M(r) = 6,000), isoelectric point (pI 6.5), and NH2-terminal sequence. The existence of ubiquitin in A. variabilis was confirmed by Southern hybridization. In in vitro experiments both cyanobacterial and bovine ubiquitin were covalently attached to several target proteins from A. variabilis, respectively. Data are presented which suggest ubiquitination of dinitrogenase reductase, the Fe-protein subunit of nitrogenase. Our findings imply that ubiquitination equivalent to the eukaryotic system is instrumental in this organism.},

Here, we show that stem cells in colonic crypts differentiate early to form precisely 1:3 ratio of secretory to absorptive cells. This precision is surprising, as there are only eight stem cells making irreversible fate decisions, and so large stochastic effects of this small pool should have yielded much larger noise in cell proportions. We use single molecule FISH, lineage-tracing mice and simulations to identify the homeostatic mechanisms facilitating robust proportions. We find that Delta-Notch lateral inhibition operates in a restricted spatial zone to reduce initial noise in cell proportions. Increased dwell time and dispersive migration of secretory cells further averages additional variability added during progenitor divisions and breaks up continuous patches of same-fate cells. These noise-reducing mechanisms resolve the trade-off between early commitment and robust differentiation and ensure spatially uniform spread of secretory cells. Our findings may apply to other cases where small progenitor pools expand to give rise to precise tissue cell proportions.},

  abstract = {Cell-to-cell transcriptional variability in otherwise homogeneous cell populations plays an important role in tissue function and development. Singlecell RNA sequencing can characterize this variability in a transcriptome-wide manner. However, technical variation and the confounding between variability and mean expression estimates hinder meaningful comparison of expression variability between cell populations. To address this problem, we introduce an analysis approach that extends the BASiCS statistical framework to derive a residual measure of variability that is not confounded by mean expression. This includes a robust procedure for quantifying technical noise in experiments where technical spike-in molecules are not available. We illustrate how our method provides biological insight into the dynamics of cell-to-cell expression variability, highlighting a synchronization of biosynthetic machinery components in immune cells upon activation. In contrast to the uniform up-regulation of the biosynthetic machinery, CD4+ T cells show heterogeneous up-regulation of immune-related and lineage-defining genes during activation and differentiation.},

We propose that these cells may contribute to differentiated cell subsets via the generation of LGR5-expressing stem cells and receive signals from surrounding mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, we draw parallels between the transcriptomes of ex~vivo tissues and in~vitro fetal organoids, revealing the maturation of organoid cultures in a dish. Lastly, we compare scRNA-seq profiles from pediatric Crohn's disease epithelium alongside matched healthy controls to reveal disease-associated changes in the epithelial composition. Contrasting these with the fetal profiles reveals the re-activation of fetal transcription factors in Crohn's disease.

Here we present a complementary approach to this problem: the design and construction of a synthetic network to implement a particular function. We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock3,4,5 to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such `rational network design' may lead both to the engineering of new cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.},

Here, we reconsider local accounts from the West African epidemic that trace its origins to people, dismissed until now as implausible. We thus reinterpret existing scientific accounts of other alleged spillovers, finding that several past outbreaks probably originated in persistent infections over even longer latency. By recalibrating the balance between `spillover' and `flare-up', we suggest that EVD manifests less as a series of discrete epidemics and more as an endemic disease in humans over long timescales and wide areas, helping to account for the increasing frequency of episodes. Epidemiologists identified the index case of the West African epidemic to be an infant in the small village of Meliandou in Guinea's Forest Region,2 {\dots}},

Immunosuppression within the TME creates a barrier between cancer cells and therapeutic approaches. A number of cells are hosted within this milieu, among them cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most abundant cell populations playing major roles in mediating an immunosuppressive TME. CAFs have cross-talks with almost all cells within the TME for reprogramming them into being tumorigenic. This reprogramming reduces the pre-existing tumor immunity and dampens the efficacy of chemotherapeutic approaches. CAFs would do this through releasing a myriad of factors to the TME making it an appropriate nest for tumor growth. The cells degrade and deposit extracellular matrix components, both of which are tumorigenic. Therefore, disruption of cross-talks between CAFs with other cells within the TME would be a promising approach in cancer targeted therapies. This approach is applicable through dampening dominant signals mediated by CAFs. Another interesting approach would be reprogramming of CAFs toward their normal counterpart. This would need identification of different subtypes for these cells and their functions. More knowledge is also required about selective markers for each CAF subtype.},

  abstract = {Numerous preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the significant contribution of inflammation to the development and progression of various types of cancer. Inflammation in the tumor microenvironment mediates complex interactions between innate immunity, adaptive immunity, microbiomes and stroma, and ultimately alters the overall fitness of tumor cells at multiple stages of carcinogenesis. Malignancies are known to arise in areas of chronic inflammation and inflammation in the tumor microenvironment (often called tumor-promoting inflammation) is believed to allow cancer cells to evade immunosurveillance while promoting genetic instability, survival and progression. Among the strongest data suggesting a causal role for inflammation in cancer come from the recent CANTOS trial which demonstrated that interleukin-1{$\beta$} (IL-1{$\beta$}) inhibition with canakinumab leads to a significant, dose-dependent decrease in incident lung cancer. This observation has launched a series of additional clinical studies to understand the role of IL-1{$\beta$} and the inflammasome in cancer, and the clinical utility of IL-1{$\beta$} inhibition in different stages of lung cancer. In this article we will review recent data implicating IL-1{$\beta$} signaling and its upstream regulator NLRP3 in both solid tumor and hematologic malignancies. We will discuss the key preclinical observations and the current clinical landscape, and describe the pharmacologic tools which will be used to evaluate the effects of blocking tumor-promoting inflammation clinically. Advances in molecular biology have markedly increased our understanding of the heterogeneous molecular landscape of colorectal cancer (CRC). Up to 15\% of CRCs harbor the BRAF p.V600E somatic mutation (BRAFmt), a well-established negative prognostic marker in patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC). The BEACON CRC trial set a new standard of care in patients with progressive BRAFmt cancers, consisting of the combination of encorafenib and cetuximab. On these bases, BRAF mutational testing is now recommended in patients with mCRC. However, efforts are needed to further stratify patients carrying this mutation. Here, we discuss the heterogeneous pathologic and molecular landscape of BRAFmt CRCs, focusing on the promises and pitfalls of molecular diagnostics, on novel biomarkers to improve patients' stratification and on the current diagnostic scenario for CRC. We believe that a better stratification based on histopathological features and novel molecular biomarkers should be performed to optimize patient management and therapeutic decision-making. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is known as one of the deadliest and most common cancers globally and causes nearly one million cancer deaths yearly. Like many malignancies, the immune system and its components play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of CRC. As multifunction mediators of the immune system, cytokines are involved in several inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) belongs to a family of 11 members and is involved in inflammatory responses. Beyond its biological role as a mediator of innate immune responses, it is also seen in chronic stress and inflammation and numerous pathological states. The role of IL-1 in malignancies can also be very significant because it has recently been shown that this cytokine can also be secreted from tumor cells and induce the recruitment of myeloid-derived immunosuppressive cells. As a result, the tumor microenvironment (TME) is affected and, despite being inflammatory, causes the onset and progression of tumor cells. Since surgery and chemotherapy are the first choices to treat patients with cancer, especially CRC, it is usually not well-prognosed, particularly in patients with metastatic lesions CRC. Therefore, targeted therapy may prolong the overall survival of CRC patients. Furthermore, evidence shows that anakinra has had satisfactory results in treating CRC. Therefore, this review summarized the role of IL-1 in the pathogenesis of CRC as well as immunotherapy based on inhibition of this cytokine in this type of cancer.},

We present here a new compartment model with the following characteristics: (a) we distinguish different classes of cells: stem cells, six generations of transit amplifying cells and the differentiated cells; (b) in order to take into account the monoclonal character of crypts in homeostatic regimes we include symmetric divisions of the stem cells. We first consider the dynamic differential equations that describe the evolution of the mean values of the populations, but the small observed value of the total number of cells involved plus the huge dispersion of experimental data found in the literature leads us to study the stochastic discrete process. This analysis allows us to study fluctuations, the neutral drift that leads to monoclonality, and the effects of the fixation of mutant clones.},

Although the evolutionary principles imparted by genetic intratumour heterogeneity are becoming increasingly clear1, little is known about the non-genetic mechanisms that contribute to intratumour heterogeneity and malignant clonal fitness2. Here, using single-cell profiling and lineage tracing (SPLINTR){\textemdash}an expressed barcoding strategy{\textemdash}we trace isogenic clones in three clinically relevant mouse models of acute myeloid leukaemia. We find that malignant clonal dominance is a cell-intrinsic and heritable property that is facilitated by the repression of antigen presentation and increased expression of the~secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor~gene (Slpi), which we genetically validate as a regulator of acute myeloid leukaemia. Increased transcriptional heterogeneity is a feature that enables clonal fitness in diverse tissues and~immune microenvironments and in the context of clonal competition between genetically distinct clones. Similar to haematopoietic stem cells3, leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) display heritable clone-intrinsic properties of high, and low clonal output that contribute to the overall tumour mass. We demonstrate that LSC clonal output dictates sensitivity to chemotherapy and, although high- and low-output clones adapt differently to therapeutic pressure, they coordinately emerge from minimal residual disease with increased expression of the LSC program. Together, these data provide fundamental insights into the non-genetic transcriptional processes that underpin malignant clonal fitness and may inform future therapeutic strategies.},

Inorganic phosphorus (PO43{\textendash}) and iron (Fe) can limit the growth and N2-fixing capacities of cyanobacteria. However, studies investigating co-limitation of these factors are lacking. Here, we added different concentrations of PO43{\textendash} and Fe in two cyanobacterial species whose relatives can be found in seagrass habitats: the unicellular Halothece sp. (PCC 7418) and the filamentous Fischerella muscicola (PCC 73103), grown under different nitrate (NO3{\textendash}) concentrations and under N2 as sole N source, respectively. Their growth, pigment content, N2-fixation rates, oxidative stress responses, and morphological and cellular changes were investigated. Our results show a serial limitation of NO3{\textendash} and PO43{\textendash} (with NO3{\textendash} as the primary limiting nutrient) for Halothece sp. Simultaneous co-limitation of PO43{\textendash} and Fe was found for both species tested, and high levels of Fe (especially when added with high PO43{\textendash} levels) inhibited the growth of Halothece sp. Nutrient limitation (PO43{\textendash}, Fe, and/or NO3{\textendash}) enhanced oxidative stress responses, morphological changes, and apoptosis. Furthermore, an extensive bio-informatic analysis describing the predicted Pho, Fur, and NtcA regulons (involved in the survival of cells to P, Fe, and N limitation) was made using the complete genome of Halothece sp. as a model, showing the potential of this strain to adapt to different nutrient regimes (P, Fe, or N).},

In the present study we investigate the role of Wnt signaling in the homeostasis of intestinal epithelium by using tissue-specific, inducible {$\beta$}-catenin gene ablation in adult mice. Block of Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin signaling resulted in rapid loss of transient-amplifying cells and crypt structures. Importantly, intestinal stem cells were induced to terminally differentiate upon deletion of {$\beta$}-catenin, resulting in a complete block of intestinal homeostasis and fatal loss of intestinal function. Transcriptional profiling of mutant crypt mRNA isolated by laser capture microdissection confirmed those observations and allowed us to identify genes potentially responsible for the functional preservation of intestinal stem cells. Our data demonstrate an essential requirement of Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin signaling for the maintenance of the intestinal epithelium in the adult organism. This challenges attempts to target aberrant Wnt signaling as a new therapeutic strategy to treat colorectal cancer.},

Conventional methods to detect antigen-reactive T cells require in vitro antigenic re-stimulation or highly individualized peptide-human leukocyte antigen (pHLA) multimers. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to identify and profile SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. To do so, we induce transcriptional shifts by antigenic stimulation in vitro and take advantage of natural T cell receptor (TCR) sequences of clonally expanded T cells as barcodes for `reverse phenotyping'. This allows identification of SARS-CoV-2-reactive TCRs and reveals phenotypic effects introduced by antigen-specific stimulation. We characterize transcriptional signatures of currently and previously activated SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells, and show correspondence with phenotypes of T cells from the respiratory tract of patients with severe disease in the presence or absence of virus in independent cohorts. Reverse phenotyping is a powerful tool to provide an integrated insight into cellular states of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells across tissues and activation states.},

As of August 28, 2014, concerns have been raised that control efforts, particularly in Liberia, have been ineffective, as reported case counts continue to increase. Limited data are available on the epidemiology of the outbreak. However, reported cumulative incidence data as well as death counts are available for Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. We utilized a simple, two parameter mathematical model of epidemic growth and control, to characterize epidemic growth patterns in West Africa, to evaluate the degree to which the epidemic is being controlled, and to assess the potential implications of growth patterns for epidemic size. Models demonstrated good fits to data. Overall basic reproductive number (R0) for the epidemic was estimated to be between 1.6 and 2.0, consistent with prior outbreaks. However, we identified only weak evidence for the occurrence of epidemic control in West Africa as a whole, and essentially no evidence for control in Liberia (though slowing of growth was seen in Guinea and Sierra Leone). It is projected that small reductions in transmission would prevent tens of thousands of future infections. These findings suggest that there is an extraordinary need for improved control measures for the 2014 Ebola epidemic, especially in Liberia, if catastrophe is to be averted.},

However, the GWAS results derive from the analysis of cohorts in which most cases are diagnosed by minimal phenotyping, a method that has low specificity. I review data indicating that there is a large genetic component unique to MDD that remains inaccessible to minimal phenotyping strategies and that the majority of genetic risk loci identified with minimal phenotyping approaches are unlikely to be MDD risk loci. I show that inventive uses of biobank data, novel imputation methods, combined with more interviewer diagnosed cases, can identify loci that contribute to the episodic severe shifts of mood, and neurovegetative and cognitive changes that are central to MDD. Furthermore, new theories about the nature and causes of MDD, drawing upon advances in neuroscience and psychology, can provide handles on how best to interpret and exploit genetic mapping results.},

Length distributions of ROH are informative about population history; specifically, the probability of inbreeding mediated by mating system and/or population demography. Here, we investigated whether variation in killer whale (Orcinus orca) demographic history is reflected in genome-wide heterozygosity and ROH length distributions, using a global data set of 26 genomes representative of geographic and ecotypic variation in this species, and two F1 admixed individuals with Pacific-Atlantic parentage. We first reconstructed demographic history for each population as changes in effective population size through time using the pairwise sequential Markovian coalescent (PSMC) method. We found a subset of populations declined in effective population size during the Late Pleistocene, while others had more stable demography. Genomes inferred to have undergone ancestral declines in effective population size, were autozygous at hundreds of short ROH ({$<$}1 Mb), reflecting high background relatedness due to coalescence of haplotypes deep within the pedigree. In contrast, longer and therefore younger ROH ({$>$}1.5 Mb) were found in low latitude populations, and populations of known conservation concern. These include a Scottish killer whale, for which 37.8\% of the autosomes were comprised of ROH {$>$}1.5 Mb in length. The fate of this population, in which only two adult males have been sighted in the past five years, and zero fecundity over the last two decades, may be inextricably linked to its demographic history and consequential inbreeding depression.},

We found that partial inhibition of the mitochondrial ATP synthase in the intestine of transgenic mice triggers an anti-inflammatory response through NFkB activation mediated by mitochondrial mtROS. This shielding phenotype is revealed when mice are challenged by DSS-induced colitis, which, in control animals, triggers inflammation, recruitment of M1 pro-inflammatory macrophages, and the activation of the pro-oncogenic STAT3 and Akt/mTOR pathways. In contrast, transgenic mice can polarize macrophages to the M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype. Using the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ to quench mtROS in vivo, we observe decreased NFkB activation, preventing its cellular protective effects. These findings stress the relevance of mitochondrial signaling to the innate immune system and emphasize the potential role of the ATP synthase as a therapeutic target in inflammatory and other related diseases.},

  abstract = {Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have increased incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). IBD-associated cancer follows a well-characterized sequence of intestinal epithelial changes, in which genetic mutations and molecular aberrations play a key role. IBD-associated cancer develops against a background of chronic inflammation and pro-inflammatory immune cells, and their products contribute to cancer development and progression. In recent years, the effect of the immunosuppressive microenvironment in cancer development and progression has gained more attention, mainly because of the unprecedented anti-tumor effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors in selected groups of patients. Even though IBD-associated cancer develops in the background of chronic inflammation which is associated with activation of endogenous anti-inflammatory or suppressive mechanisms, the potential role of an immunosuppressive microenvironment in these cancers is largely unknown. In this review, we outline the role of the immune system in promoting cancer development in chronic inflammatory diseases such as IBD, with a specific focus on the anti-inflammatory mechanisms and suppressive immune cells that may play a role in IBD-associated tumorigenesis.},

The risk of second surgery in Crohn's disease and the influence of time are not well characterized. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to establish the risk of second abdominal surgery in patients with Crohn's disease among patients who had a previous surgery. METHODS: We searched Medline, EMBASE, PubMed (March 2014), and conference proceedings for terms related to Crohn's disease and intestinal surgery. We included population-based articles (n=11) and an abstract (n=1) reporting surgical risk for the overall study period and for 5 and 10 years after the first surgery for Crohn's disease. We stratified studies by year (start year before vs. after 1980) to explore the role of time. RESULTS: For all population-based studies, the overall risk of second surgery was 28.7\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 22.6-36.6\%). The 5-year risk of second surgery was 24.2\% (95\% CI: 22.3-26.4\%). The 10-year risk of second surgery was 35.0\% (95\% CI: 31.8-38.6\%). A significant difference in the 10-year risk of second surgery was observed over time such that studies conducted after 1980 had a lower risk of second surgery (33.2\%; 95\% CI: 31.2-35.4\%) compared with those that started before 1980 (44.6\%; 95\% CI: 37.7-52.7\%). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-quarter of Crohn's disease patients who have a first surgery also have a second, and the majority of these surgeries occur within 5 years of the first surgery. The 10-year risk of second surgery is significantly decreasing over time.},

The database contains 32 954 aligned nitrogenase nifH sequences linked to phylogenetic trees and associated sequence metadata. The database includes 185 linked multigene entries including full-length nifH, nifD, nifK and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences. Evolutionary analyses enabled by the multigene entries support an ancient horizontal transfer of nitrogenase genes between Archaea and Bacteria and provide evidence that nifH has a different history of horizontal gene transfer from the nifDK enzyme core. Further analyses show that lineages in nitrogenase cluster I and cluster III have different rates of substitution within nifD, suggesting that nifD is under different selection pressure in these two lineages. Finally, we find that that the genetic divergence of nifH and 16S rRNA genes does not correlate well at sequence dissimilarity values used commonly to define microbial species, as stains having {$<$}3\% sequence dissimilarity in their 16S rRNA genes can have up to 23\% dissimilarity in nifH. The nifH database has a number of uses including phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses, the design and assessment of primers/probes and the evaluation of nitrogenase sequence diversity., Database URL: http://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/buckley/nifh.htm},

The quality of genome assemblies is estimated by their contiguity and the occurrences of misassemblies (duplications, deletions, translocations or inversions). The rapid development of sequencing technologies has enabled the rise of novel de novo genome assembly strategies. The ultimate goal of such strategies is to utilise the features of each sequencing platform in order to address the existing weaknesses of each sequencing type and compose a complete and correct genome map. In the present study, the hybrid strategy, which is based on Illumina short paired-end reads and Nanopore long reads, was benchmarked using MaSuRCA and Wengan assemblers. Moreover, the long-read assembly strategy, which is based on Nanopore reads, was benchmarked using Canu or PacBio HiFi reads were benchmarked using Hifiasm and HiCanu. The assemblies were performed on a computational cluster with limited computational resources. Their outputs were evaluated in terms of accuracy and computational performance. PacBio HiFi assembly strategy outperforms the other ones, while Hi-C scaffolding, which is based on chromatin 3D structure, is required in order to increase continuity, accuracy and completeness when large and complex genomes, such as the human one, are assembled. The use of Hi-C data is also necessary while using the hybrid assembly strategy. The results revealed that HiFi sequencing enabled the rise of novel algorithms which require less genome coverage than that of the other strategies making the assembly a less computationally demanding task. Taken together, these developments may lead to the democratisation of genome assembly projects which are now approachable by smaller labs with limited technical and financial resources.},

Many of the models being deployed are amenable to scalable stochastic inference techniques, and accordingly they are able to process single-cell datasets of realistic and growing sizes. However, the community-wide adoption of probabilistic approaches is hindered by a fractured software ecosystem resulting in an array of packages with distinct, and often complex interfaces. To address this issue, we developed scvi-tools (             https://scvi-tools.org             ), a Python package that implements a variety of leading probabilistic methods. These methods, which cover many fundamental analysis tasks, are accessible through a standardized, easy-to-use interface with direct links to Scanpy, Seurat, and Bioconductor workflows. By standardizing the implementations, we were able to develop and reuse novel functionalities across different models, such as support for complex study designs through nonlinear removal of unwanted variation due to multiple covariates and reference-query integration via scArches. The extensible software building blocks that underlie scvi-tools also enable a developer environment in which new probabilistic models for single cell omics can be efficiently developed, benchmarked, and deployed. We demonstrate this through a code-efficient reimplementation of Stereoscope for deconvolution of spatial transcriptomics profiles. By catering to both the end user and developer audiences, we expect scvi-tools to become an essential software dependency and serve to formulate a community standard for probabilistic modeling of single cell omics.},

The colon is the final area for recapturing electrolytes and water prior to excretion, and in order to maintain this electrolyte homeostasis, a complex interaction between secretory and absorptive processes is necessary. Until recently it was thought that secretion and absorption were two distinct processes associated with either crypts or surface cells, respectively. Recently it was demonstrated that both the surface and crypt cells can perform secretory and absorptive functions and that, in fact, these functions can be going on simultaneously. This issue is important in the complexities associated with secretory diarrhea and also in attempting to develop treatment strategies for intestinal disorders. Here, we update the model of colonic secretion and absorption, discuss new issues of transporter activation, and identify some important new receptor pathways that are important modulators of the secretory and absorptive functions of the colon.},

  abstract = {We re-analyzed the data from a recent large-scale study that reported strong correlations between microbial organisms and 33 different cancer types, and that created machine learning predictors with near-perfect accuracy at distinguishing among cancers. We found at least two fundamental flaws in the reported data and in the methods: (1) errors in the genome database and the associated computational methods led to millions of false positive findings of bacterial reads across all samples, largely because most of the sequences identified as bacteria were instead human; and (2) errors in transformation of the raw data created an artificial signature, even for microbes with no reads detected, tagging each tumor type with a distinct signal that the machine learning programs then used to create an apparently accurate classifier. Each of these problems invalidates the results, leading to the conclusion that the microbiome-based classifiers for identifying cancer presented in the study are entirely wrong. These flaws have subsequently affected more than a dozen additional published studies that used the same data and whose results are likely invalid as well.},

To infer past population dynamics from molecular sequence data, coalescent-based models have been developed for Bayesian nonparametric estimation of effective population size over time. Among the most successful is a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) model for a single gene locus. Here, we present a generalization of the GMRF model that allows for the analysis of multilocus sequence data. Using simulated data, we demonstrate the improved performance of our method to recover true population trajectories and the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA). We analyze a multilocus alignment of HIV-1 CRF02\_AG gene sequences sampled from Cameroon. Our results are consistent with HIV prevalence data and uncover some aspects of the population history that go undetected in Bayesian parametric estimation. Finally, we recover an older and more reconcilable TMRCA for a classic ancient DNA data set.},

Neoplasia hijacks regenerative signaling, so we assessed the distribution of CBCs and RSCs in mouse and human intestinal tumors. Using combined molecularmorphological analysis, we demonstrate variable expression of stem cell markers across a range of lesions. The degree of CBC-RSC admixture was associated with both epithelial mutation and microenvironmental signaling disruption and could be mapped across disease molecular subtypes. The CBC-RSC equilibrium was adaptive, with a dynamic response to acute selective pressure, and adaptability was associated with chemoresistance. We propose a fitness landscape model where individual tumors have equilibrated stem cell population distributions along a CBC-RSC phenotypic axis. Cellular plasticity is represented by position shift along this axis and is influenced by cell-intrinsic, extrinsic, and therapeutic selective pressures.},

Early detection of indices associated with recurrence and risk stratification are fundamental for the postoperative management of patients. Early endoscopy at 6-12 months is the ``gold standard'' procedure, whereas other modalities such as fecal calprotectin and imaging techniques can contribute to the diagnosis of recurrence. The purpose of this review is to summarize current data regarding risk factors correlated with postoperative relapse. Smoking is a well-established, modifiable risk factor. There are sufficient data that correlate penetrating disease, perianal involvement, extensive resections, prior surgery, histological features (plexitis and granulomas), and improper management after resection with high rates for recurrence. The literature provides conflicting data for other possible predictors, such as age, sex, family history of inflammatory bowel disease, location of disease, strictureplasties, blood transfusions, and postoperative complications, necessitating further evidence. On the other hand, surgical factors such as anastomotic configuration, open or laparoscopic approach, and microscopic disease at specimen margins when macroscopic disease is resected, seem not to be related with an increased risk of recurrence. Further recognition of histological features as well as gene-related factors are promising fields for research.},

However, recent observations suggest that ES cell populations are heterogeneous with respect to the expression of Nanog and that individual ES cells reversibly change their Nanog expression level. Furthermore, it has been shown that cells exhibiting a low Nanog level are more likely to undergo differentiation. Applying a novel mathematical transcription factor network model we explore mechanisms and feedback regulations to describe the observed variation of the Nanog levels in mouse ES cells. In particular we show that these variations can occur under different assumptions yielding similar experimental characteristics. Based on model predictions we propose experimental strategies to distinguish between these explanations. Concluding from our results we argue that the heterogeneity with respect to the Nanog concentrations is most likely a functional element to control the differentiation propensity of an ES cell population. Furthermore, we provide a conceptual framework that consistently explains Nanog variability and a potential ``gate-keeper'' function of Nanog expression with respect to the control of ES cell differentiation.},

The motivation behind using gene sets instead of individual genes is two-fold. First, this approach incorporates pre-existing biological knowledge into the analysis and facilitates the interpretation of experimental results. Second, it employs a statistical hypotheses testing framework. Here, we briefly review main Gene Set Analysis (GSA) approaches for testing differential expression of gene sets and several GSA approaches for testing statistical hypotheses beyond differential expression that allow extracting additional biological information from the data. We distinguish three major types of GSA approaches testing: (1) differential expression (DE), (2) differential variability (DV), and (3) differential co-expression (DC) of gene sets between two phenotypes. We also present comparative power analysis and Type I error rates for different approaches in each major type of GSA on simulated data. Our evaluation presents a concise guideline for selecting GSA approaches best performing under particular experimental settings. The value of the three major types of GSA approaches is illustrated with real data example. While being applied to the same data set, major types of GSA approaches result in complementary biological information.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Many statistical tests have been proposed in recent years for analyzing gene expression data in terms of gene sets, usually from Gene Ontology. These methods are based on widely different methodological assumptions. Some approaches test differential expression of each gene set against differential expression of the rest of the genes, whereas others test each gene set on its own. Also, some methods are based on a model in which the genes are the sampling units, whereas others treat the subjects as the sampling units. This article aims to clarify the assumptions behind different approaches and to indicate a preferential methodology of gene set testing.Results: We identify some crucial assumptions which are needed by the majority of methods. P-values derived from methods that use a model which takes the genes as the sampling unit are easily misinterpreted, as they are based on a statistical model that does not resemble the biological experiment actually performed. Furthermore, because these models are based on a crucial and unrealistic independence assumption between genes, the P-values derived from such methods can be wildly anti-conservative, as a simulation experiment shows. We also argue that methods that competitively test each gene set against the rest of the genes create an unnecessary rift between single gene testing and gene set testing.Contact:j.j.goeman@lumc.nl},

  abstract = {The intestine is a highly dynamic environment that requires tight control of the various inputs to maintain homeostasis and allow for proper responses to injury. It was recently found that the stem cell niche and epithelium is regenerated after injury by de-differentiated adult cells, through a process that gives rise to Sca1+ fetal-like cells and is driven by a transient population of Clu+ revival stem cells (revSCs). However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate this dynamic process have not been fully defined. Here we show that TNFAIP8 (also known as TIPE0) is a regulator of intestinal homeostasis that is vital for proper regeneration. TIPE0 functions through inhibiting basal Akt activation by the commensal microbiota via modulating membrane phospholipid abundance. Loss of TIPE0 in mice results in injury-resistant enterocytes, that are hyperproliferative, yet have regenerative deficits and are shifted towards a de-differentiated state. Tipe0-/- enterocytes show basal induction of the Clu+ regenerative program and a fetal gene expression signature marked by Sca1, but upon injury are unable to generate Sca-1+/Clu+ revSCs and could not regenerate the epithelium. This work demonstrates the role of TIPE0 in regulating the dynamic signaling that determines the injury response and enables intestinal epithelial cell regenerative plasticity.},

The introduction of effective insecticides, such as the organophosphate pirimiphos-methyl, is essential to overcome the recurrent emergence of resistance driven by the highly diverse Anopheles genomes. Here, we use a population genomic approach to investigate the basis of pirimiphos-methyl resistance in the major malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae and A. coluzzii. A combination of copy number variation and a single non-synonymous substitution in the acetylcholinesterase gene, Ace1, provides the key resistance diagnostic in an A. coluzzii population from C{\^o}te d'Ivoire that we used for sequence-based association mapping, with replication in other West African populations. The Ace1 substitution and duplications occur on a unique resistance haplotype that evolved in A. gambiae and introgressed into A. coluzzii, and is now common in West Africa primarily due to selection imposed by other organophosphate or carbamate insecticides. Our findings highlight the predictive value of this complex resistance haplotype for phenotypic resistance and clarify its evolutionary history, providing tools to for molecular surveillance of the current and future effectiveness of pirimiphos-methyl based interventions.},

  abstract = {The gut epithelium has remarkable self-renewal capacity that under homeostatic conditions is driven by Wnt signalling in Lgr5(+) intestinal stem cells (ISCs). However, the mechanisms underlying ISC regeneration after injury remain poorly understood. The Hippo signalling pathway mediates tissue growth and is important for regeneration. Here we demonstrate in mice that Yap, a downstream transcriptional effector of Hippo, is critical for recovery of intestinal epithelium after exposure to ionizing radiation. Yap transiently reprograms Lgr5(+) ISCs by suppressing Wnt signalling and excessive Paneth cell differentiation, while promoting cell survival and inducing a regenerative program that includes Egf pathway activation. Accordingly, growth of Yap-deficient organoids is rescued by the Egfr ligand epiregulin, and we find that non-cell-autonomous production of stromal epiregulin may compensate for Yap loss in vivo. Consistent with key roles for regenerative signalling in tumorigenesis, we further demonstrate that Yap inactivation abolishes adenomas in the Apc(Min) mouse model of colon cancer, and that Yap-driven expansion of Apc(-/-) organoids requires the Egfr module of the Yap regenerative program. Finally, we show that in vivo Yap is required for progression of early Apc mutant tumour-initiating cells, suppresses their differentiation into Paneth cells, and induces a regenerative program and Egfr signalling. Our studies reveal that upon tissue injury, Yap reprograms Lgr5(+) ISCs by inhibiting the Wnt homeostatic program, while inducing a regenerative program that includes activation of Egfr signalling. Moreover, our findings reveal a key role for the Yap regenerative pathway in driving cancer initiation.},

  abstract = {The Nuclear Factor I (NFI ) family of site-specific DNA-binding proteins (also known as CTF or CAAT box transcription factor) functions both in viral DNA replication and in the regulation of gene expression. The classes of genes whose expression is modulated by NFI include those that are ubiquitously expressed, as well as those that are hormonally, nutritionally, and developmentally regulated. The NFI family is composed of four members in vertebrates (NFI-A, NFI-B, NFI-C and NFI-X ), and the four NFI genes are expressed in unique, but overlapping, patterns during mouse embryogenesis and in the adult. Transcripts of each NFI gene are differentially spliced, yielding as many as nine distinct proteins from a single gene. Products of the four NFI genes differ in their abilities to either activate or repress transcription, likely through fundamentally different mechanisms. Here, we will review the properties of the NFI genes and proteins and their known functions in gene expression and development. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

I will then point out the distinction between forward and reverse modeling and focus thereafter on the former. Instead of going into mathematical technicalities about different varieties of models, I will focus on their logical structure, in terms of assumptions and conclusions. A model is a logical machine for deducing the latter from the former. If the model is correct, then, if you believe its assumptions, you must, as a matter of logic, also believe its conclusions. This leads to consideration of the assumptions underlying models. If these are based on fundamental physical laws, then it may be reasonable to treat the model as `predictive', in the sense that it is not subject to falsification and we can rely on its conclusions. However, at the molecular level, models are more often derived from phenomenology and guesswork. In this case, the model is a test of its assumptions and must be falsifiable. I will discuss three models from this perspective, each of which yields biological insights, and this will lead to some guidelines for prospective model builders.},

  abstract = {Background Synthetic long reads (SLR) with long-range co-barcoding information are now widely applied in genomics research. Although several tools have been developed for each specific SLR technique, a robust standalone scaffolder with high efficiency is warranted for hybrid genome assembly. Results In this work, we developed a standalone scaffolding tool, SLR-superscaffolder, to link together contigs in draft assemblies using co-barcoding and paired-end read information. Our top-to-bottom scheme first builds a global scaffold graph based on Jaccard Similarity to determine the order and orientation of contigs, and then locally improves the scaffolds with the aid of paired-end information. We also exploited a screening algorithm to reduce the negative effect of misassembled contigs in the input assembly. We applied SLR-superscaffolder to a human single tube long fragment read sequencing dataset and increased the scaffold NG50 of its corresponding draft assembly 1349 fold. Moreover, benchmarking on different input contigs showed that this approach overall outperformed existing SLR scaffolders, providing longer contiguity and fewer misassemblies, especially for short contigs assembled by next-generation sequencing data. The open-source code of SLR-superscaffolder is available at https://github.com/BGI-Qingdao/SLR-superscaffolder. Conclusions SLR-superscaffolder can dramatically improve the contiguity of a draft assembly by integrating a hybrid assembly strategy.

The small and large intestines differ markedly in cell composition and function, reflecting their distinct stem cell populations. Here we show that SATB2, a colon-restricted chromatin factor, singularly preserves LGR5+ adult colonic stem cell and epithelial identity in mice and humans. Satb2 loss in adult mice leads to stable conversion of colonic stem cells into small intestine ileal-like stem cells and replacement of the colonic mucosa with one that resembles the ileum. Conversely, SATB2 confers colonic properties on the mouse ileum. Human colonic organoids also adopt ileal characteristics upon SATB2 loss. SATB2 regulates colonic identity in part by modulating enhancer binding of the intestinal transcription factors CDX2 and HNF4A. Our study uncovers a conserved core regulator of colonic stem cells able to mediate cross-tissue plasticity in mature intestines.},

Progenitor cells can compensate for insults to the stem cell population through dedifferentiation. The microenvironment modulates this regenerative response by influencing the activity of signaling pathways, including Wnt, Notch, and YAP/TAZ. For instance, mesenchymal cells and immune cells become more abundant after damage and secrete signaling molecules that promote the regenerative process. Furthermore, regeneration is influenced by the nutritional state, microbiome, and extracellular matrix. Here, we review how all these components cooperate to restore epithelial homeostasis in the intestine after injury.},

Currently, accurate long read assemblers are computationally expensive, whereas faster methods are not as accurate. Moreover, despite recent advances in third-generation sequencing, researchers still tend to generate accurate short reads for many of the analysis tasks. Here, we present HASLR, a hybrid assembler that uses error-prone long reads together with high-quality short reads to efficiently generate accurate genome assemblies.

As knowledge of cancer mechanisms has progressed, other facets of the disease have emerged as potential refinements. Herein, the prospect is raised that phenotypic plasticity and disrupted differentiation is a discrete hallmark capability, and that nonmutational epigenetic reprogramming and polymorphic microbiomes both constitute distinctive enabling characteristics that facilitate the acquisition of hallmark capabilities. Additionally, senescent cells, of varying origins, may be added to the roster of functionally important cell types in the tumor microenvironment. SIGNIFICANCE: Cancer is daunting in the breadth and scope of its diversity, spanning genetics, cell and tissue biology, pathology, and response to therapy. Ever more powerful experimental and computational tools and technologies are providing an avalanche of "big data" about the myriad manifestations of the diseases that cancer encompasses. The integrative concept embodied in the hallmarks of cancer is helping to distill this complexity into an increasingly logical science, and the provisional new dimensions presented in this perspective may add value to that endeavor, to more fully understand mechanisms of cancer development and malignant progression, and apply that knowledge to cancer medicine.},

  abstract = {The colonic epithelial turnover is driven by crypt-base stem cells that express the R-spondin receptor Lgr5. Signals that regulate epithelial regeneration upon stem cell injury are largely unknown. Here, we explore the dynamics of Wnt signaling in the colon. We identify two populations of cells with active Wnt signaling: highly proliferative Lgr5+/Axin2+ cells, as well as secretory Lgr5-/Axin2+ cells. Upon Lgr5+ cell depletion, these cells are recruited to contribute to crypt regeneration. Chemical injury induced by DSS leads to a loss of both Lgr5+ cells and Axin2+ cells and epithelial regeneration is driven by Axin2-~cells, including differentiated Krt20+ surface enterocytes. Regeneration requires stromal Rspo3, which is present at increased levels upon injury and reprograms Lgr5- but Lgr4+ differentiated cells. In contrast, depletion of stromal Rspo3 impairs crypt regeneration, even upon mild injury. We demonstrate that Rspo3 is essential for epithelial repair via induction of Wnt signaling in differentiated cells.},

  abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with repeated remissions and relapses. As the disease progresses, fibrosis and narrowing of the intestine occur, leading to severe complications such as intestinal obstruction. Endoscopic balloon dilatation, surgical stricture plasty, and bowel resection have been performed to treat intestinal stenosis. The clinical issue is that some patients with CD have a recurrence of intestinal stenosis even after the medical treatments. On the other hand, there exist no established medical therapies to prevent stenosis. With the progressive intestinal inflammation, cytokines and growth factors, including transforming growth factor (TGF-{$\beta$}), stimulate intestinal myofibroblasts, contributing to fibrosis of the intestine, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and mesenteric fat hypertrophy. Therefore, chronically sustained inflammation has long been considered a cause of intestinal fibrosis and stenosis. Still, even after the advent of biologics and tighter control of inflammation, intestinal fibrosis's surgical rate has not necessarily decreased. It is essential to elucidate the mechanisms involved in intestinal fibrosis in CD from a molecular biological level to overcome clinical issues. Recently, much attention has been paid to several key molecules of intestinal fibrosis: peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor gamma (PPAR{$\gamma$}), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), Th17 immune response, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). As a major problem in the treatment of CD, the pathophysiology of patients with CD is not the same and varies depending on each patient. It is necessary to integrate these key molecules for a better understanding of the mechanism of intestinal inflammation and fibrosis.},

Mutant organoids self-renew and grow independently of essential growth factors and exhibit elevated levels of nuclear Yap, Mll1, and H3K4 trimethylation. These factors are also elevated in human colorectal cancer (CRC) and control viability of patient-derived CRC organoids. Yap interacts with Mll1, and both promote a regenerative cell state that links regenerative processes to tumorigenesis.           ,              Specified intestinal epithelial cells reprogram and contribute to the regeneration and renewal of the epithelium upon injury. Mutations that deregulate such renewal processes may contribute to tumorigenesis. Using intestinal organoids, we show that concomitant activation of Notch signaling and ablation of p53 induce a highly proliferative and regenerative cell state, which is associated with increased levels of Yap and the histone methyltransferase Mll1. The induced signaling system orchestrates high proliferation, self-renewal, and niche-factor-independent growth, and elevates the trimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3). We demonstrate that Yap and Mll1 are also elevated in patient-derived colorectal cancer (CRC) organoids and control growth and viability. Our data suggest that Notch activation and p53 ablation induce a signaling circuitry involving Yap and the epigenetic regulator Mll1, which locks cells in a proliferative and regenerative state that renders them susceptible for tumorigenesis.},

Here, we show that YAP and TAZ are also recruited by JUNB (a member of the AP-1 family) and STAT3, key transcription factors that mediate an epigenetic switch linking inflammation to cellular transformation. YAP and TAZ directly interact with JUNB and STAT3 via a WW domain important for transformation, and they stimulate transcriptional activation by AP-1 proteins. JUNB, STAT3, and TEAD co-localize at virtually all YAP/TAZ target sites, yet many target sites only contain individual AP-1, TEAD, or STAT3 motifs. This observation and differences in relative crosslinking efficiencies of JUNB, TEAD, and STAT3 at YAP/TAZ target sites suggest that YAP/TAZ is recruited by different forms of an AP-1/STAT3/TEAD complex depending on the recruiting motif. The different classes of YAP/TAZ target sites are associated with largely non-overlapping genes with distinct functions. A small minority of target sites are YAP- or TAZ-specific, and they are associated with different sequence motifs and gene classes from shared YAP/TAZ target sites. Genes containing either the AP-1 or TEAD class of YAP/TAZ sites are associated with poor survival of breast cancer patients with the triple-negative form of the disease.},

  abstract = {Until recently, high-throughput gene expression technology, such as RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) required hundreds of thousands of cells to produce reliable measurements. Recent technical advances permit genome-wide gene expression measurement at the single-cell level. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) is the most widely used and numerous publications are based on data produced with this technology. However, RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data are markedly different. In particular, unlike RNA-seq, the majority of reported expression levels in scRNA-seq are zeros, which could be either biologically-driven, genes not expressing RNA at the time of measurement, or technically-driven, genes expressing RNA, but not at a sufficient level to be detected by sequencing technology. Another difference is that the proportion of genes reporting the expression level to be zero varies substantially across single cells compared to RNA-seq samples. However, it remains unclear to what extent this cell-to-cell variation is being driven by technical rather than biological variation. Furthermore, while systematic errors, including batch effects, have been widely reported as a major challenge in high-throughput technologies, these issues have received minimal attention in published studies based on scRNA-seq technology. Here, we use an assessment experiment to examine data from published studies and demonstrate that systematic errors can explain a substantial percentage of observed cell-to-cell expression variability. Specifically, we present evidence that some of these reported zeros are driven by technical variation by demonstrating that scRNA-seq produces more zeros than expected and that this bias is greater for lower expressed genes. In addition, this missing data problem is exacerbated by the fact that this technical variation varies cell-to-cell. Then, we show how this technical cell-to-cell variability can be confused with novel biological results. Finally, we demonstrate and discuss how batch-effects and confounded experiments can intensify the problem.},

Minimal information models have been used in other communities to establish community consensus around simple models capable of communicating useful information. This paper reports on a new minimal information model for describing potential drug-drug interactions. A task force of the Semantic Web in Health Care and Life Sciences Community Group of the World-Wide Web consortium engaged informaticians and drug-drug interaction experts in in-depth examination of recent literature and specific potential interactions. A consensus set of information items was identified, along with example descriptions of selected potential drug-drug interactions (PDDIs). User profiles and use cases were developed to demonstrate the applicability of the model. Ten core information items were identified: drugs involved, clinical consequences, seriousness, operational classification statement, recommended action, mechanism of interaction, contextual information/modifying factors, evidence about a suspected drug-drug interaction, frequency of exposure, and frequency of harm to exposed persons. Eight best practice recommendations suggest how PDDI knowledge artifact creators can best use the 10 information items when synthesizing drug interaction evidence into artifacts intended to aid clinicians. This model has been included in a proposed implementation guide developed by the HL7 Clinical Decision Support Workgroup and in PDDIs published in the CDS Connect repository. The complete description of the model can be found at https://w3id.org/hclscg/pddi.},

Methods Here we used single-cell transcriptomics to elucidate changes in distinct cell types and their interactions in a mouse model of chemically induced colitis. Results Our analysis highlights the stromal cell population of the colon functions as a hub with dynamically changing roles over time. Importantly, we found that Serpina3n, a serine protease inhibitor, is specifically expressed in stromal cell clusters as inflammation resolves, interacting with a potential target, elastase. Indeed, genetic ablation of the Serpina3n gene delays resolution of induced inflammation. Furthermore, systemic Serpina3n administration promoted the resolution of inflammation, ameliorating colitis symptoms.

Here, we show that MDR1 has an unexpected protective role for the mitochondria where MDR1 deficiency results in mitochondrial dysfunction with increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) driving the development of colitis. Exogenous induction of mROS accelerates, while inhibition attenuates colitis in vivo; these effects are amplified in MDR1 deficiency. In human IBD, MDR1 is negatively correlated to SOD2 gene expression required for mROS detoxification. To provide direct evidential support, we deleted intestinal SOD2 gene in mice and showed an increased susceptibility to colitis. We exploited the genome-wide association data sets and found many ({$\sim$}5\%) of IBD susceptibility genes with direct roles in regulating mitochondria homeostasis. As MDR1 primarily protects against xenotoxins via its efflux function, our findings implicate a distinct mitochondrial toxin+genetic susceptibility interaction leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, a novel pathogenic mechanism that could offer many new therapeutic opportunities for IBD.},

  abstract = {The intestine is a highly proliferative dynamic environment that relies on constant self-renewal of the intestinal epithelium to maintain homeostasis. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein 8 (TNFAIP8 or TIPE0) is a regulator of PI3K-mediated signaling. By binding to PIP2 and PIP3, TIPE family members locally activate PI3K activity while globally inhibiting PI3K activity through sequestration of membranous PIP2. Single-cell RNA sequencing survey of Tipe0-/- small intestine was used to investigate the role of TIPE0 in intestinal differentiation. Tipe0-/- intestinal cells were shown to shift towards an undifferentiated state, with the notable exception of goblet cells. Additionally, three possible novel regulators of terminal cell fate decisions in the secretory lineage were identified: Nupr1, Kdm4a, and Gatad1. We propose that these novel regulators drive changes involved in goblet cell (Nupr1) or tuft cell (Kdm4a and Gatad1) fate commitment and that TIPE0 may play a role in orchestrating terminal differentiation.},

Crohn's disease is assumed to be the result of a complex interplay between genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and altered intestinal microbiota, leading to dysregulation of the innate and adaptive immune response. While many genetic variants have been identified to be associated with Crohn's disease, less is known about the influence of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of this disease. In this review, we provide an overview of current epigenetic studies in Crohn's disease. In particular, we enable a deeper insight into applied bioanalytical and computational tools, as well as a comprehensive update toward the cell-specific evaluation of DNA methylation and histone modifications.},

  abstract = {A variety of methods based on coalescent theory have been developed to infer demographic history from gene sequences sampled from natural populations. The `skyline plot' and related approaches are commonly employed as flexible prior distributions for phylogenetic trees in the Bayesian analysis of pathogen gene sequences. In this work we extend the classic and generalized skyline plot methods to phylogenies that contain one or more multifurcations (i.e. hard polytomies). We use the theory of {$\Lambda$}-coalescents (specifically, Beta(2-{$\alpha$},{$\alpha$})-coalescents) to develop the `multifurcating skyline plot', which estimates a piecewise constant function of effective population size through time, conditional on a time-scaled multifurcating phylogeny. We implement a smoothing procedure and extend the method to serially sampled (heterochronous) data, but we do not address here the problem of estimating trees with multifurcations from gene sequence alignments. We validate our estimator on simulated data using maximum likelihood and find that parameters of the Beta(2-{$\alpha$},{$\alpha$}) -coalescent process can be estimated accurately. Furthermore, we apply the multifurcating skyline plot to simulated trees generated by tracking transmissions in an individual-based model of epidemic superspreading. We find that high levels of superspreading are consistent with the high-variance assumptions underlying {$\Lambda$}-coalescents and that the estimated parameters of the {$\Lambda$}-coalescent model contain information about the degree of superspreading.},

Whilst working towards improved datasets and fully automated pipelines, assembly evaluation and curation is actively used to bridge this shortcoming and significantly reduce the number of assembly errors. In addition to this increase in product value, the insights gained from assembly curation are fed back into the automated assembly strategy and contribute to notable improvements in genome assembly quality. We describe our tried and tested approach for assembly curation using gEVAL, the genome evaluation browser. We outline the procedures applied to genome curation using gEVAL and also our recommendations for assembly curation in a gEVAL-independent context to facilitate the uptake of genome curation in the wider community.},

But how ratios of lineage-determining transcription factors stabilize progenitor cells and resolve their indeterminacy to commit them to discrete, mutually exclusive fates remains unexplained. We used a simple model and experimental measurements to analyze the dynamics of a binary fate decision governed by a gene-circuit containing auto-stimulation and cross-inhibition, as embodied by the GATA1{\textendash}PU.1 paradigm. This circuit generates stable attractors corresponding to erythroid and myelomonocytic fates, as well as an uncommitted metastable state characterized by coexpression of both regulators, explaining the phenomenon of ``multilineage priming''. GATA1 and PU.1 mRNA and transcriptome dynamics of differentiating progenitor cells confirm that commitment occurs in two stages, as suggested by the model: first, the progenitor state is destabilized in an almost symmetrical bifurcation event, resulting in a poised state at the boundary between the two lineage-specific attractors; second, the cell is driven to the respective, now accessible attractors. This minimal model captures fundamental features of binary cell fate decisions, uniting the concepts of stochastic (selective) and deterministic (instructive) regulation, and hence, may apply to a wider range of binary fate decision points.},

Some supervised or semi-supervised classification methods have recently emerged to enable automated cell type identification. However, comprehensive evaluations of these methods are lacking. Moreover, it is not clear whether some classification methods originally designed for analyzing other bulk omics data are adaptable to scRNA-seq analysis. In this study, we evaluated ten cell type annotation methods publicly available as R packages. Eight of them are popular methods developed specifically for single-cell research, including Seurat, scmap, SingleR, CHETAH, SingleCellNet, scID, Garnett, and SCINA. The other two methods were repurposed from deconvoluting DNA methylation data, i.e., linear constrained projection (CP) and robust partial correlations (RPC). We conducted systematic comparisons on a wide variety of public scRNA-seq datasets as well as simulation data. We assessed the accuracy through intra-dataset and inter-dataset predictions; the robustness over practical challenges such as gene filtering, high similarity among cell types, and increased cell type classes; as well as the detection of rare and unknown cell types. Overall, methods such as Seurat, SingleR, CP, RPC, and SingleCellNet performed well, with Seurat being the best at annotating major cell types. Additionally, Seurat, SingleR, CP, and RPC were more robust against downsampling. However, Seurat did have a major drawback at predicting rare cell populations, and it was suboptimal at differentiating cell types highly similar to each other, compared to SingleR and RPC. All the code and data are available from https://github.com/qianhuiSenn/scRNA\_cell\_deconv\_benchmark.},

We investigated the mutation incidence and the role of mSWI/SNF (BAF) complexes in human lung cancer. In the present study, we analyzed somatic mutations of BAF complexes and other driver mutated genes of lung carcinoma deposited in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database. BAF complexes were mutated in 282 of 803 (35.12\%) lung carcinoma samples analyzed, ranking second to TP53. Significantly, BAF-mutated samples exhibited more genomic mutations than BAF wild-type ones. Moreover, a significant positive correlation existed between the BAF mutations and overall genomic mutations in these lung carcinoma samples (P{$<$}0.001, Pearson's correlation analysis). Specifically, the mutant-typing of 6 BAF genes, SMARCA4, ARID2, ARID1B, BCL11A, BCL11B and BRD9 was associated with more overall mutations in the lung carcinoma samples. A mutation reporter system was developed by means of the establishment of stable cell sublines with slippage-luciferase transcript in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line, Calu-3. SMARCA4, the most frequently mutated BAF gene in lung cancer, was stably knocked down by pSUPER constructs carrying short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Mutation ratios determined from the mutation reporters of Calu-3 cells were significantly increased upon stable SMARCA4 knockdown. We demonstrated that genetic mutations of BAF complexes lead to genome instability of lung carcinoma. Therefore, BAF complexes play an important role in maintaining genome stability in human lung cancer.},

Despite the clear power of online data resources, including web-available databases, proliferation can be problematic due to challenges in sustainability and long-term persistence. As areas of research become increasingly dependent on access to collections of data, an understanding of the scientific community's capacity to develop and maintain such resources is needed. The advent of the Internet coincided with expanding adoption of database technologies in the early 1990s, and the molecular biology community was at the forefront of using online databases to broadly disseminate data. The journal Nucleic Acids Research has long published articles dedicated to the description of online databases, as either debut or update articles. Snapshots throughout the entire history of online databases can be found in the pages of Nucleic Acids Research's ``Database Issue.'' Given the prominence of the Database Issue in the molecular biology and bioinformatics communities and the relative rarity of consistent historical documentation, database articles published in Database Issues provide a particularly unique opportunity for longitudinal analysis. To take advantage of this opportunity, the study presented here first identifies each unique database described in 3055 Nucleic Acids Research Database Issue articles published between 1991 and 2016 to gather a rich dataset of databases debuted during this time frame, regardless of current availability. In total, 1,727 unique databases were identified and associated descriptive statistics were gathered for each, including year debuted in a Database Issue and the number of all associated Database Issue publications and accompanying citation counts. Additionally, each database identified was assessed for current availability through testing of all associated URLs published. Finally, to assess maintenance, database websites were inspected to determine the last recorded update. The resulting work allows for an examination of the overall historical trends, such as the rate of database proliferation and attrition as well as an evaluation of citation metrics and on-going database maintenance.},

The results reveal a diverse set of contributing organizations with financial and operational support spread across six categories: academic, consortium/collective, government, industry, philanthropic, and society/association. The majority of databases reported support from more than one funding organization, of which government organizations were most common source of funds. Operational responsibilities were more distributed, with academic organizations serving as the most common hosts. Although there is evidence of diversification overall, the most acknowledged funding and operating organizations contribute to disproportionately large percentages of the long-lived databases investigated here.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ongoing West African Ebola epidemic began in December 2013 in Guinea, probably from a single zoonotic introduction. As a result of ineffective initial control efforts, an Ebola outbreak of unprecedented scale emerged. As of 4 May 2015, it had resulted in more than 19,000 probable and confirmed Ebola cases, mainly in Guinea (3,529), Liberia (5,343), and Sierra Leone (10,746). Here, we present analyses of data collected during the outbreak identifying drivers of transmission and highlighting areas where control could be improved. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Over 19,000 confirmed and probable Ebola cases were reported in West Africa by 4 May 2015. Individuals with confirmed or probable Ebola ("cases") were asked if they had exposure to other potential Ebola cases ("potential source contacts") in a funeral or non-funeral context prior to becoming ill. We performed retrospective analyses of a case line-list, collated from national databases of case investigation forms that have been reported to WHO. These analyses were initially performed to assist WHO's response during the epidemic, and have been updated for publication. We analysed data from 3,529 cases in Guinea, 5,343 in Liberia, and 10,746 in Sierra Leone; exposures were reported by 33\% of cases. The proportion of cases reporting a funeral exposure decreased over time. We found a positive correlation (r = 0.35, p {$<$} 0.001) between this proportion in a given district for a given month and the within-district transmission intensity, quantified by the estimated reproduction number (R). We also found a negative correlation (r = -0.37, p {$<$} 0.001) between R and the district proportion of hospitalised cases admitted within {$\leq$}4 days of symptom onset. These two proportions were not correlated, suggesting that reduced funeral attendance and faster hospitalisation independently influenced local transmission intensity. We were able to identify 14\% of potential source contacts as cases in the case line-list. Linking cases to the contacts who potentially infected them provided information on the transmission network. This revealed a high degree of heterogeneity in inferred transmissions, with only 20\% of cases accounting for at least 73\% of new infections, a phenomenon often called super-spreading. Multivariable regression models allowed us to identify predictors of being named as a potential source contact. These were similar for funeral and non-funeral contacts: severe symptoms, death, non-hospitalisation, older age, and travelling prior to symptom onset. Non-funeral exposures were strongly peaked around the death of the contact. There was evidence that hospitalisation reduced but did not eliminate onward exposures. We found that Ebola treatment units were better than other health care facilities at preventing exposure from hospitalised and deceased individuals. The principal limitation of our analysis is limited data quality, with cases not being entered into the database, cases not reporting exposures, or data being entered incorrectly (especially dates, and possible misclassifications). CONCLUSIONS: Achieving elimination of Ebola is challenging, partly because of super-spreading. Safe funeral practices and fast hospitalisation contributed to the containment of this Ebola epidemic. Continued real-time data capture, reporting, and analysis are vital to track transmission patterns, inform resource deployment, and thus hasten and maintain elimination of the virus from the human population.},

We investigated the zoonotic origins of the epidemic using wildlife surveys, interviews, and molecular analyses of bat and environmental samples. We found no evidence for a concurrent outbreak in larger wildlife. Exposure to fruit bats is common in the region, but the index case may have been infected by playing in a hollow tree housing a colony of insectivorous free-tailed bats (Mops condylurus). Bats in this family have previously been discussed as potential sources for Ebola virus outbreaks, and experimental data have shown that this species can survive experimental infection. These analyses expand the range of possible Ebola virus sources to include insectivorous bats and reiterate the importance of broader sampling efforts for understanding Ebola virus ecology.},

Although the mesenchyme and the extracellular matrix (ECM) play critical roles in tissue homeostasis and regeneration2{\textendash}5, their role in repurposing developmental programs in epithelium is unknown. To model epithelial regeneration, we culture intestinal epithelium on decellularized small intestinal scaffold (iECM), and identify Asporin (Aspn), an ECM bound proteoglycan, as a critical mediator of cellular reprogramming. Aspn is produced by the mesenchyme, and we show that its effect on epithelial Tgf{$\beta$}-signalling via CD44 is critical for fetal-like conversion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Aspn is transiently increased upon chemotherapy-induced damage and pivotal for a timely induction of the fetal-like state and tissue regeneration. In summary, we establish a platform for modelling epithelial injury responses ex vivo, and show that the mesenchymal Aspn-producing niche controls tissue repair by regulating epithelial fetal-like reprogramming.},

Several studies have shown that IBD patients have signs of increased oxidative damage, which could be a result of genetic and environmental factors such as an excess in oxidant molecules released during chronic inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, a failure in antioxidant capacity, or oxidant promoting diets. It has been suggested that chronic oxidative environment in the intestine leads to the DNA lesions that precipitate colon carcinogenesis in IBD patients. Indeed, several preclinical and clinical studies show that different endogenous and exogenous antioxidant molecules are effective at reducing oxidation in the intestine. However, most clinical studies have focused on the short-term effects of antioxidants in IBD patients but not in CAC. This review article examines the role of oxidative DNA damage as a possible precipitating event in CAC in the context of chronic intestinal inflammation and the potential role of exogenous antioxidants to prevent these cancers.},

EVD outbreaks typically start from a single case of probable zoonotic transmission, followed by human-to-human transmission via direct contact or contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated fomites. EVD has a high case{\textendash}fatality rate; it is characterized by fever, gastrointestinal signs and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Diagnosis requires a combination of case definition and laboratory tests, typically real-time reverse transcription PCR to detect viral RNA or rapid diagnostic tests based on immunoassays to detect EBOV antigens. Recent advances in medical countermeasure research resulted in the recent approval of an EBOV-targeted vaccine by European and US regulatory agencies. The results of a randomized clinical trial of investigational therapeutics for EVD demonstrated survival benefits from two monoclonal antibody products targeting the EBOV membrane glycoprotein. New observations emerging from the unprecedented 2013{\textendash}2016 Western African EVD outbreak (the largest in history) and the ongoing EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have substantially improved the understanding of EVD and viral persistence in survivors of EVD, resulting in new strategies toward prevention of infection and optimization of clinical management, acute illness outcomes and attendance to the clinical care needs of patients.},

ForceAtlas2 is a force-directed layout close to other algorithms used for network spatialization. We do not claim a theoretical advance but an attempt to integrate different techniques such as the Barnes Hut simulation, degree-dependent repulsive force, and local and global adaptive temperatures. It is designed for the Gephi user experience (it is a continuous algorithm), and we explain which constraints it implies. The algorithm benefits from much feedback and is developed in order to provide many possibilities through its settings. We lay out its complete functioning for the users who need a precise understanding of its behaviour, from the formulas to graphic illustration of the result. We propose a benchmark for our compromise between performance and quality. We also explain why we integrated its various features and discuss our design choices.},

Disrupting Lgr5+ ISCs triggers epithelial renewal from Bmi1+ cells, from secretory or absorptive progenitors, and from Paneth cell precursors, revealing a high degree of plasticity within intestinal crypts. Here, we show that GFP+ cells from Bmi1GFP mice are preterminal enteroendocrine cells and we identify CD69+CD274+ cells as related goblet cell precursors. Upon loss of native Lgr5+ ISCs, both populations revert toward an Lgr5+ cell identity. While active histone marks are distributed similarly between Lgr5+ ISCs and progenitors of both major lineages, thousands of cis elements that control expression of lineage-restricted genes are selectively open in secretory cells. This accessibility signature dynamically converts to that of Lgr5+ ISCs during crypt regeneration. Beyond establishing the nature of Bmi1GFP+ cells, these findings reveal how chromatin status underlies~intestinal cell diversity and dedifferentiation to restore ISC function and intestinal homeostasis.},

  abstract = {We generated genome sequences from 218 cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Sierra Leone (SLE) during 2014{\textendash}2015 to complement available datasets, particularly by including cases from a period of low sequence coverage during peak transmission of Ebola virus (EBOV) in the highly-affected Western Area division of SLE. The combined dataset was utilized to produce phylogenetic and phylodynamic inferences, to study sink{\textendash}source dynamics and virus dispersal from highly-populated transmission hotspots. We identified four districts in SLE where EBOV was introduced and transmission occurred without onward exportation to other districts. We also identified six districts that substantially contributed to the dispersal of the virus and prolonged the EVD outbreak: five of these served as major hubs, with lots of movement in and out, and one acted primarily as a source, exporting the virus to other areas of the country. Positive correlations between case numbers, inter-district transition events, and district population sizes reaffirm that population size was a driver of EBOV transmission dynamics in SLE. The data presented here confirm the role of urban hubs in virus dispersal and of a delayed laboratory response in the expansion and perpetuation of the EVD outbreak in SLE.},

  abstract = {With the ever-increasing number of publicly available eukaryotic genome assemblies and user-friendly bioinformatics tools, there are increasing opportunities for researchers to use genomic resources in their research. While there are multiple dimensions to genome quality, it is often reduced to a single score that may not be correlated with other metrics, or appropriate for all applications of an assembly. To assess whether the commonly reported N50 value could reliably predict a separate dimension of genome quality, gene space completeness, we performed a meta-analysis of 611 published articles on eukaryotic genomes that used BUSCO scores, in addition to the typical N50 score. We found that although assemblies with relatively high contig and scaffold N50 values consistently had high BUSCO scores, a high BUSCO score could also be obtained from assemblies with a low N50. This reinforces that despite its ubiquity, N50 is not a perfect proxy for all measures of genome accuracy. Our data also suggests that variations in BUSCO scores among assemblies with poor N50 scores may be related to the number of introns in conserved eukaryotic genes. We stress the importance of screening and evaluating assembly quality based on the appropriate tools and urge increased reporting of additional genome assessment metrics in addition to N50. We also discuss the potential limitations of BUSCO and suggest improvements for assessing gene space within genome assemblies.},

  abstract = {The mechanisms linking chronic inflammation of the gut (IBD) and increased colorectal cancer susceptibility are poorly understood. IBD risk is influenced by genetic factors, including the IBD5 locus (human 5q31), that harbors the IRF1 gene. A cause-to-effect relationship between chronic inflammation and colorectal cancer, and a possible role of IRF1 were studied in Irf1-/- mice in a model of colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CA-CRC) induced by azoxymethane and dextran sulfate. Loss of Irf1 causes hyper-susceptibility to CA-CRC, with early onset and increased number of tumors leading to rapid lethality. Transcript profiling (RNA-seq) and immunostaining of colons shows heightened inflammation and enhanced enterocyte proliferation in Irf1-/- mutants, prior to appearance of tumors. Considerable infiltration of leukocytes is seen in Irf1-/- colons at this early stage, and is composed primarily of proinflammatory Gr1+ Cd11b+ myeloid cells and other granulocytes, as well as CD4+ lymphoid cells. Differential susceptibility to CA-CRC of Irf1-/- vs. B6 controls is fully transferable through hematopoietic cells as observed in bone marrow chimera studies. Transcript signatures seen in Irf1-/- mice in response to AOM/DSS are enriched in clinical specimens from patients with IBD and with colorectal cancer. In addition, IRF1 expression in the colon is significantly decreased in late stage colorectal cancer (stages 3, 4) and is associated with poorer prognosis. This suggests that partial or complete loss of IRF1 expression alters the type, number, and function of immune cells in situ during chronic inflammation, possibly via the creation of a tumor-promoting environment.},

Neither the farmers nor the raccoon dogs had symptoms (e.g., diarrhea) at the time of sample collection. We collected 14 stool samples from two farms, and 85.7\% (12/14) of the samples were norovirus positive by RT-PCR. The two norovirus genomes have the highest identity to Dog/Z7/19/CH, suggesting that the norovirus might have been transmitted from dogs to raccoon dogs. Genomic and evolutionary analyses indicated that different directions of evolution occurred following the spread of the norovirus to the raccoon dogs. This study has increased knowledge of norovirus-infected animal species and has provided additional information on the norovirus family.},

Currently, a limited number of computational tools are available for this task, and quantitative methods for comparing different tools are lacking. Tools for Single Cell Analysis (TSCAN) is a software tool developed to better support in silico pseudo-Time reconstruction in Single-Cell RNA-seq ANalysis. TSCAN uses a cluster-based minimum spanning tree (MST) approach to order cells. Cells are first grouped into clusters and an MST is then constructed to connect cluster centers. Pseudo-time is obtained by projecting each cell onto the tree, and the ordered sequence of cells can be used to study dynamic changes of gene expression along the pseudo-time. Clustering cells before MST construction reduces the complexity of the tree space. This often leads to improved cell ordering. It also allows users to conveniently adjust the ordering based on prior knowledge. TSCAN has a graphical user interface (GUI) to support data visualization and user interaction. Furthermore, quantitative measures are developed to objectively evaluate and compare different pseudo-time reconstruction methods. TSCAN is available at https://github.com/zji90/TSCAN and as a Bioconductor package.},

The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes ( {$>$} 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

In this work we present EMBEDR, which assesses the output of any DR algorithm to distinguish evidence of structure from algorithm-induced noise in DR outputs. We apply EMBEDR to DR-generated representations of single-cell omics data of several modalities to show where they visually show real{\textemdash}not spurious{\textemdash}structure. EMBEDR generates a ``p'' value for each sample, allowing for direct comparisons of DR algorithms and facilitating optimization of algorithm hyperparameters. We show that the scale of a sample's neighborhood can thus be determined and used to generate a novel ``cell-wise optimal'' embedding. EMBEDR is available as a Python package for immediate use.},

We aimed to establish the current, and project future, prevalence in Lothian, Scotland. Design We conducted an all-age multiparameter search strategy using inpatient IBD international classification of disease (ICD-10) coding (K50/51)(1997{\textendash}2018), IBD pathology coding (1990{\textendash}2018), primary and secondary care prescribing data (2009{\textendash}2018) and a paediatric registry, (1997{\textendash}2018) to identify `possible' IBD cases up to 31/08/2018. Diagnoses were manually confirmed through electronic health record review as per Lennard-Jones/Porto criteria. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) regression was applied to forecast prevalence to 01/08/2028. Results In total, 24 601 possible IBD cases were identified of which 10 499 were true positives. The point prevalence for IBD in Lothian on 31/08/2018 was 784/100 000 (UC 432/100 000, Crohn's disease 284/100 000 and IBD unclassified (IBDU) 68/100 000). Capture{\textendash}recapture methods identified an additional 427 `missed' cases (95\% CI 383 to 477) resulting in a `true' prevalence of 832/100 000 (95\% CI 827 to 837).Prevalence increased by 4.3\% per year between 2008 and 2018 (95\% CI +3.7 to +4.9\%, p{$<$}0.0001). ARIMA modelling projected a point prevalence on 01/08/2028 of 1.02\% (95\% CI 0.97\% to 1.07\%) that will affect an estimated 1.53\% (95\% CI 1.37\% to 1.69\%) of those {$>$}80 years of age. Conclusions We report a rigorously validated IBD cohort with all-age point prevalence on 31/08/2018 of 1 in 125, one of the highest worldwide.},

Notably, mSWI/SNF subunits are mutated in 19.6\% of all human tumors reported in 44 studies. Our analysis suggests that specific subunits protect against cancer in specific tissues. In addition, mutations affecting more than one subunit, defined here as compound heterozygosity, are prevalent in certain cancers. Our studies demonstrate that mSWI/SNF is the most frequently mutated chromatin-regulatory complex (CRC) in human cancer, exhibiting a broad mutation pattern, similar to that of TP53. Thus, proper functioning of polymorphic BAF complexes may constitute a major mechanism of tumor suppression.},

  abstract = {In the mammalian intestine, crypts of Leiberk{\"u}hn house intestinal epithelial stem/progenitor cells at their base. The mammalian intestine also harbors a diverse array of microbial metabolite compounds that potentially modulate stem/progenitor cell activity. Unbiased screening identified butyrate, a prominent bacterial metabolite, as a potent inhibitor of intestinal stem/progenitor proliferation at physiologic concentrations. During homeostasis, differentiated colonocytes metabolized butyrate likely preventing it from reaching proliferating epithelial stem/progenitor cells within the crypt. Exposure of stem/progenitor cells in~vivo to butyrate through either mucosal injury or application to a naturally crypt-less host organism led to inhibition of proliferation and delayed wound repair. The mechanism of butyrate action depended on the transcription factor Foxo3. Our findings indicate that mammalian crypt architecture protects stem/progenitor cell proliferation in part through a metabolic barrier formed by differentiated colonocytes that consume butyrate and stimulate future studies on the interplay of host anatomy and microbiome metabolism.},

  abstract = {Background Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a chronic, idiopathic, repeated inflammatory disease. Colorectal cancer (CRC) that develops in patients with IBD is known as colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC), but the underlying carcinogenic mechanism remains unclear. Genomic analysis of sporadic CRC has been well described based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Using NGS, we compared all exons of 415 cancer-associated genes in patients in Japan and the USA who had CRC and found similar genomic alteration patterns among the two populations. However, genomic analysis of CAC has not been thoroughly investigated. Main body The molecular pathogenesis of CAC shares many features with sporadic CRC, but there are distinct variations in the time and frequency of some alterations. Gene alterations in CAC are gradually being elucidated using genomic sequencing analyses. Some studies have shown that gene alteration patterns differ between UC and CD. The carcinogenesis of CAC depends on unique environmental, genetic, and immunological factors. Conclusions In this review, we have discussed the differences in genomic alterations between sporadic CRC and CAC. NGS in patients with IBD has the potential to detect early CAC and to suggest therapeutic targets.},

Organoid-based studies using parasite-derived excretory/secretory products reveal that Hpb-mediated revSC generation occurs independent of host-derived immune signals and inhibits type 2 cytokine-driven differentiation of secretory epithelial lineages that promote their expulsion. Reciprocally, type 2 cytokine signals limit revSC differentiation and, consequently, Hpb fitness indicating that helminths compete with their host for control of the intestinal stem cell niche to promote continuation of their life cycle.},

In this study we observed that administration of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonists suppressed the severity of experimental colitis in RAG1-/- but not in SCID mice. This differential responsiveness between phenotypically similar but genetically distinct animals was related to a partial blockade in TLR9 signaling and defective production of type I IFN (i.e., IFN-alpha/beta) in SCID mice upon TLR9 stimulation. The addition of neutralization antibodies against type I IFN abolished the antiinflammatory effects induced by TLR9 agonists, whereas the administration of recombinant IFN-beta mimicked the antiinflammatory effects induced by TLR9 agonists in this model. Furthermore, mice deficient in the IFN-alpha/beta receptor exhibited more severe colitis than wild-type mice did upon induction of experimental colitis. These results indicate that TLR9-triggered type I IFN has antiinflammatory functions in colitis. They also underscore the important protective role of type I IFN in intestinal homeostasis and suggest that strategies to modulate innate immunity may be of therapeutic value for the treatment of intestinal inflammatory conditions.},

Prior analysis of PerturbSeq measured the overall effect of a perturbation on each gene, however it remains difficult to capture temporal responses to a perturbation. In this thesis, we compare the effectiveness of three RNA velocity informed models and two cell-cell similarity based models in providing a pseudo-temporal ordering of cells. We find pseudotime estimated with the dynamical model for computing velocity provides the most reliable ordering of cells. We use this pseudo-temporal ordering to bin cells into three time resolved groups and compute the effect of a perturbation at each time point. This analysis provides a promising start to understanding the temporal effects of a perturbation.},

These genomes form a well-supported phylogenetic cluster with genomes from the previous outbreak, which indicates that the new outbreak was not the result of a new spillover event from an animal reservoir. The 2021 lineage shows considerably lower divergence than would be expected during sustained human-to-human transmission, which suggests a persistent infection with reduced replication or a period of latency.

  abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, debilitating, phenotypically heterogeneous disorder with heritability ranges from 30\% to 50\%. Compared to other psychiatric disorders, its high prevalence, moderate heritability, and strong polygenicity have posed major challenges for gene-mapping in MDD. Studies of common genetic variation in MDD, driven by large international collaborations such as the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, have confirmed the highly polygenic nature of the disorder and implicated over 100 genetic risk loci to date. Rare copy number variants associated with MDD risk were also recently identified. The goal of this review is to present a broad picture of our current understanding of the epidemiology, genetic epidemiology, molecular genetics, and gene-environment interplay in MDD. Insights into the impact of genetic factors on the aetiology of this complex disorder hold great promise for improving clinical care.},

  abstract = {Background/Aims: A major long-term risk for patients with chronic idiopathic colitis is the development of colorectal dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. The presence or absence of specific genetic changes in these lesions will provide important insights into the relationship of colitis-associated dysplasia and the development of carcinoma. Methods: A case-study approach was used to develop detailed molecular genetic profiles of advanced dysplasias and carcinomas from six patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's colitis. Results: Numerous genetic alterations were identified in each of the dysplasias and carcinomas profiled. These genetic alterations involved many of the same targets found in sporadic colorectal tumors and included multiple sites of allelic deletion, microsatellite instabilities, and mutations of the K-ras, p53, and APC genes. The progression of dysplasia to carcinoma was often accompanied by an accumulation of these mutations. Conclusions: Genetic alterations are common in colitis-associated neoplasia, just as in sporadic colorectal neoplasia. This could have important implications for the evaluation and treatment of patients with colitis.},

  abstract = {Globally, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer death. Arising through three major pathways, including adenoma-carcinoma sequence, serrated pathway and inflammatory pathway, CRC represents an aetiologically heterogeneous disease according to subtyping by tumour anatomical location or global molecular alterations. Genetic factors such as germline MLH1 and APC mutations have an aetiologic role, predisposing individuals to CRC. Yet, the majority of CRC is sporadic and largely attributable to the constellation of modifiable environmental risk factors characterizing westernization (for example, obesity, physical inactivity, poor diets, alcohol drinking and smoking). As such, the burden of CRC is shifting towards low-income and middle-income countries as they become westernized. Furthermore, the rising incidence of CRC at younger ages (before age 50 years) is an emerging trend. This Review provides a comprehensive summary of CRC epidemiology, with emphasis on modifiable lifestyle and nutritional factors, chemoprevention and screening. Overall, the optimal reduction of CRC incidence and mortality will require concerted efforts to reduce modifiable risk factors, to leverage chemoprevention research and~to promote population-wide and targeted screening.},

We collected a unique survey data from 303 respondents from 41 research institutes and R\&D centres in Australia and tested the model using structural equation modelling. The results suggest that all three knowledge-based dynamic capabilities can enhance perceived knowledge worker productivity, but knowledge acquisition capability has a stronger correlation with knowledge worker productivity. We also found significant moderating impacts of traits of organizational culture on several relationships. The model has significant implications for management and demonstrates that strengthening knowledge capabilities and understanding the influence of organizational culture will enhance the response of professional service firms to environmental complexities. Further implications for management include the increased utilisation of capacity to create and develop new knowledge, combine internal and external knowledge, and enhance knowledge worker productivity.},

  abstract = {Background: Ebola virus disease has reemerged as a major public health crisis in Africa, with isolated cases also observed globally, during the current outbreak. Methods: To estimate the basic reproductive ratio R0, which is a measure of the severity of the outbreak, we developed a SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered) type deterministic model, and used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for the Ebola outbreak in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Two different data sets are available: one with raw reported data and one with corrected data (as the CDC suspects under-reporting). Results: Using a deterministic ordinary differential equation transmission model for Ebola epidemic, the basic reproductive ratio R0 for Liberia resulted to be 1.757 and 1.9 for corrected and uncorrected case data, respectively. For Sierra Leone, R0 resulted to be 1.492 and 1.362 for corrected and uncorrected case data, respectively. In each of the two cases we considered, the estimate for the basic reproductive ratio was initially greater than unity leading to an epidemic outbreak. Conclusion: We obtained robust estimates for the value of R0 associated with the 2014 Ebola outbreak, and showed that there is close agreement between our estimates of R0. Analysis of our model also showed that effective isolation is required, with the contact rate in isolation less than one quarter of that for the infected non-isolated population, and that the fraction of high-risk individuals must be brought to less than 10\% of the overall susceptible population, in order to bring the value of R0 to less than 1, and hence control the outbreak.},

  abstract = {Cells differentiate when transcription factors bind accessible cis-regulatory elements to establish specific gene expression programs. In differentiating embryonic stem cells, chromatin at lineage-restricted genes becomes sequentially accessible, probably by means of 'pioneer' transcription factor activity, but tissues may use other strategies in vivo. Lateral inhibition is a pervasive process in which one cell forces a different identity on its neighbours, and it is unclear how chromatin in equipotent progenitors undergoing lateral inhibition quickly enables distinct, transiently reversible cell fates. Here we report the chromatin and transcriptional underpinnings of differentiation in mouse small intestine crypts, where notch signalling mediates lateral inhibition to assign progenitor cells into absorptive or secretory lineages. Transcript profiles in isolated LGR5(+) intestinal stem cells and secretory and absorptive progenitors indicated that each cell population was distinct and the progenitors specified. Nevertheless, secretory and absorptive progenitors showed comparable levels of H3K4me2 and H3K27ac histone marks and DNase I hypersensitivity--signifying accessible, permissive chromatin-at most of the same cis-elements. Enhancers acting uniquely in progenitors were well demarcated in LGR5(+) intestinal stem cells, revealing early priming of chromatin for divergent transcriptional programs, and retained active marks well after lineages were specified. On this chromatin background, ATOH1, a secretory-specific transcription factor, controls lateral inhibition through delta-like notch ligand genes and also drives the expression of numerous secretory lineage genes. Depletion of ATOH1 from specified secretory cells converted them into functional enterocytes, indicating prolonged responsiveness of marked enhancers to the presence or absence of a key transcription factor. Thus, lateral inhibition and intestinal crypt lineage plasticity involve interaction of a lineage-restricted transcription factor with broadly permissive chromatin established in multipotent stem cells.},

  abstract = {Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk for developing colorectal cancer (CRC), although the overall incidence of IBD-associated CRC has been diminishing in recent decades in western countries. As demonstrated in previous studies, the risk of CRC in IBD increases with longer duration, extent of colitis, a familial history of CRC, coexistent primary sclerosing cholangitis, and the degree of inflammation. The pathogenesis of CRC in IBD is poorly understood. Similar to sporadic CRC, IBD-associated CRC is a consequence of sequential episodes of genomic alteration. Multiple inter-related pathways, including immune response by mucosal inflammatory mediators, oxidative stress, and intestinal microbiota, are also involved the pathogenesis of IBD-associated CRC. Continuing colonic inflammation appears to be a factor in the development of CRC; therefore, anti-inflammatory agents such as 5-aminosalicylate compounds and immune modulators have been considered as potential chemopreventive agents. Colonoscopic surveillance is widely accepted as being effective in reducing the risk of IBD-associated CRC, although no clear evidence has confirmed that surveillance colonoscopy prolongs survival in patients with extensive colitis. The traditional recommendation has been quadrantic random biopsies throughout the entire colon; however, several guidelines now have endorsed chromoendoscopy with a target biopsy because of increasing diagnostic yields and reduced workloads for endoscopists and pathologists. New technologies such as narrow band imaging, confocal endomicroscopy, and autofluorescence imaging have not yet been confirmed as surveillance strategies in IBD.},

In this study, we examined the expression profiles of these markers in colitis-associated carcinogenesis (CAC) to investigate whether they can be used as biomarkers for the early detection of dysplasia. The expression of intestinal stem cell (ISC) markers was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction during CAC that was induced by azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate treatment. CBC stem cell markers increased continuously with tumor development, whereas a +4 cell expression profile was not present. CBC stem cell population was suppressed in the acute colitis and then expanded to repopulate the crypts during the regeneration period. Notably, RNA in situ hybridization revealed that all dysplasia and cancer samples showed increased expression of CBC stem cell markers in more than one-third of the tumor height, whereas regenerative glands had CBC stem cell markers confined to the lower one-third of the crypt. These results suggest that CBC stem cell markers could be a useful tool for the early detection of colitis-induced tumors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Intestinal crypts constitute a niche in which epithelial progenitors respond to Wnt signals, replicate, and prepare to differentiate. Because mutations in Wnt pathway genes lead to intestinal cancer, the role of Wnt signaling in gut epithelial homeostasis is a subject of intense investigation. We studied how Wnt signaling is established during intestine development. METHODS: We studied spatiotemporal features of Wnt signaling at formative stages in mouse embryos, when villous projections appear and crypt precursors occupy intervillus regions. We used TOP-GAL transgenic and Axin2(LacZ) mice, which report faithfully on canonical Wnt activity, relevant molecular markers, and embryos with aberrant beta-catenin activation. RESULTS: Developing intestines first display evidence for Wnt signaling after appearance of villi. During villus morphogenesis, intervillus cells proliferate actively but lack signs of canonical Wnt signaling. Surprisingly, in late gestation and briefly thereafter, conspicuous Wnt activity is evident in differentiated, postmitotic villus epithelium. Neither Tcf4, a principal transcriptional effector of intestinal Wnt signals, nor candidate Wnt targets CD44 and cyclinD1 are expressed in late fetal villus cells that show high Wnt activity. Instead, those cells express the related factor Tcf3 and a different Wnt target, c-Myc. Premature and deregulated beta-catenin activation causes severe villus dysmorphogenesis in transgenic mice. CONCLUSIONS: Relationships among Wnt signaling, epithelial proliferation, and tissue differentiation are reversed in the developing and adult gut. The canonical Wnt pathway has independent, albeit possibly overlapping, functions in early intestinal villi and adult crypts. These observations advance understanding of Wnt functions in intestinal development and disease.},

This double-negative feedback loop is part of a bistable trigger that makes the transition into mitosis abrupt and decisive. To generate a bistable response, some component of a double-negative feedback loop must exhibit an ultrasensitive response to its upstream regulator. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that Wee1 exhibits a highly ultrasensitive response to Cdk1. Several mechanisms can, in principle, give rise to ultrasensitivity, including zero-order effects, multisite phosphorylation, and competition mechanisms. We found that the ultrasensitivity in the inactivation of Wee1 arises mainly through two competition mechanisms: competition between two sets of phosphorylation sites in Wee1 and between Wee1 and other highaffinity Cdk1 targets. Based on these findings, we were able to reconstitute a highly ultrasensitive Wee1 response with purified components. Competition provides a simple way of generating the equivalent of a highly cooperative allosteric response.},

  abstract = {Yes-associated protein (YAP) and its homolog transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are key effectors of the Hippo pathway to control cell growth and organ size, of which dysregulation yields to tumorigenesis or hypertrophy. Upon activation, YAP/TAZ translocate into the nucleus and bind to TEAD transcription factors to promote transcriptional programs for proliferation or cell specification. Immediate early genes, represented by AP-1 complex, are rapidly induced and control later-phase transcriptional program to play key roles in tumorigenesis and organ maintenance. Here, we report that YAP/TAZ directly promote FOS transcription that in turn contributes to the biological function of YAP/TAZ. YAP/TAZ bind to the promoter region of FOS to stimulate its transcription. Deletion of YAP/TAZ blocks the induction of immediate early genes in response to mitogenic stimuli. FOS induction contributes to expression of YAP/TAZ downstream target genes. Genetic deletion or chemical inhibition of AP-1 suppresses growth of YAP-driven cancer cells, such as Lats1/2-deficient cancer cells as well as G{$\alpha$}q/11 mutated uveal melanoma. Furthermore, AP-1 inhibition almost completely abrogates the hepatomegaly induced by YAP overexpression. Our findings reveal a feed-forward interplay between immediate early transcription of AP-1 and Hippo pathway function.},

Several tools have recently been developed to close the gaps in these assemblies with NGS reads. Although these gap-closing tools efficiently close the gaps, they entail a high rate of misassembly at gap-closing sites.Results: We have found that the assembly error rates caused by these tools are 20{\textendash}500-fold higher than the rate of errors introduced into contigs by de novo assemblers. We here describe GMcloser, a tool that accurately closes these gaps with a preassembled contig set or a long read set (i.e. error-corrected PacBio reads). GMcloser uses likelihood-based classifiers calculated from the alignment statistics between scaffolds, contigs and paired-end reads to correctly assign contigs or long reads to gap regions of scaffolds, thereby achieving accurate and efficient gap closure. We demonstrate with sequencing data from various organisms that the gap-closing accuracy of GMcloser is 3{\textendash}100-fold higher than those of other available tools, with similar efficiency.Availability and implementation: GMcloser and an accompanying tool (GMvalue) for evaluating the assembly and correcting misassemblies except SNPs and short indels in the assembly are available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/gmcloser/.Contact: shunichi.kosugi@riken.jpSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Metastasis remains the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Lung cancer remains lethal, known for its highly metastatic progression. The unknown genomic profile of metastatic tumors coupled with their ability to selectively spread among different organs suggests more studies are needed to understand these different pathways. However, a bottleneck in metastatic cancer research is our insufficient understanding of these mechanisms, particularly how cancer cells are transported outside the primary tumor to specific distant metastatic sites. Unfortunately, access to the primary driver of malignancy, the metastatic cancer cell clusters (MCCCs), remains difficult and limited. These metastatic clusters have been shown to be 100-fold more tumorigenic than individual cancer cells. Capturing and characterizing MCCCs is a key limiting factor in efforts to help treat and ultimately prevent cancer metastasis. Understanding the biological pathways occurring within MCCCs will help uncover new therapeutic drug targets to help combat cancer metastases. We demonstrate a novel, proof of principle technology, to capture MCCCs directly from patients' whole blood. Our tunable platform combines a biomimicry-based margination effect coupled with immunoaffinity to isolate MCCCs. Adopting a ``selective' capture approach based on cancer cells overexpressing CD44, provides a methodology that preferentially isolates highly metastatic cells from whole blood. Furthermore, we demonstrate a high capture efficiency of 90\% by isolating our model system MCCCs directly from whole blood. Characterization of the captured MCCCs from lung cancer patients by immunofluorescence staining and genomic analyses, reveals previously unseen potential drug targets that can unlock a new area of anti-metastatic therapeutics. Significance Understanding the molecular signaling pathways of metastasis is essential for developing new therapeutics designed to prevent cancer's spread. Isolating and characterizing the metastatic cancer cell clusters, which are more tumorigenic versus individual cancer cells, directly from cancer patients, is essential for finding unseen targets for new anti-metastatic drug development.},

Here we highlight the genomic changes that might negatively impact the efficacy of currently available EBOV sequence-based candidate therapeutics, such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs), and antibodies. Ten of the observed mutations modify the sequence of the binding sites of monoclonal antibody (MAb) 13F6, MAb 1H3, MAb 6D8, MAb 13C6, and siRNA EK-1, VP24, and VP35 targets and might influence the binding efficacy of the sequence-based therapeutics, suggesting that their efficacy should be reevaluated against the currently circulating strain.},

  abstract = {Whereas the adult gastrointestinal epithelium undergoes tremendous self-renewal through active proliferation in crypt stem cell compartments, the responsible growth factors regulating this continuous proliferation have not been defined. The exploration of physiologic functions of Wnt proteins in adult organisms has been hampered by functional redundancy and the necessity for conditional inactivation strategies. Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) is a potent secreted Wnt antagonist that interacts with Wnt coreceptors of the LRP family. To address the contribution of Wnt signaling to gastrointestinal epithelial proliferation, adenoviral expression of Dkk1 was used to achieve stringent, conditional, and reversible Wnt inhibition in adult animals. Adenovirus Dkk1 (Ad Dkk1) treatment of adult mice repressed expression of the Wnt target genes CD44 and EphB2 within 2 days in both small intestine and colon, indicating an extremely broad role for Wnt signaling in the maintenance of adult gastrointestinal gene expression. In parallel, Ad Dkk1 markedly inhibited proliferation in small intestine and colon, accompanied by progressive architectural degeneration with the loss of crypts, villi, and glandular structure by 7 days. Whereas decreased Dkk1 expression at later time points ({$>$}10 days) was followed by crypt and villus regeneration, which was consistent with a reversible process, substantial mortality ensued from colitis and systemic infection. These results indicate the efficacy of systemic expression of secreted Wnt antagonists as a general strategy for conditional inactivation of Wnt signaling in adult organisms and illustrate a striking reliance on a single growth factor pathway for the maintenance of the architecture of the adult small intestine and colon.},

Coding-complete genomic sequence analyses of isolates revealed that the two outbreaks were caused by two novel EBOV variants, and initial clinical observations suggest that neither of them should be considered strains.

  abstract = {Evolutionary information on species divergence times is fundamental to studies of biodiversity, development, and disease. Molecular dating has enhanced our understanding of the temporal patterns of species divergences over the last five decades, and the number of studies is increasing quickly due to an exponential growth in the available collection of molecular sequences from diverse species and large number of genes. Our TimeTree resource is a public knowledge-base with the primary focus to make available all species divergence times derived using molecular sequence data to scientists, educators, and the general public in a consistent and accessible format. Here, we report a major expansion of the TimeTree resource, which more than triples the number of species (\&gt;97,000) and more than triples the number of studies assembled (\&gt;3,000). Furthermore, scientists can access not only the divergence time between two species or higher taxa, but also a timetree of a group of species and a timeline that traces a species' evolution through time. The new timetree and timeline visualizations are integrated with display of events on earth and environmental history over geological time, which will lead to broader and better understanding of the interplay of the change in the biosphere with the diversity of species on Earth. The next generation TimeTree resource is publicly available online at http://www.timetree.org.},

While multiple early introductions of EBOV to Liberia are evident, the majority of Liberian EVD cases are consistent with a single introduction, followed by spread and diversification within the country. Movement of the virus within Liberia was widespread, and reintroductions from Liberia served as an important source for the continuation of the already ongoing EVD outbreak in Guinea. Overall, little evidence was found for incremental adaptation of EBOV to the human host.},

Its remarkable propensity to develop resistance threatens the viability of the sheep industry in many regions of the world and provides a cautionary example of the effect of mass drug administration to control parasitic nematodes. Its phylogenetic position makes it particularly well placed for comparison with the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the most economically important parasites of livestock and humans. Results: Here we report the detailed analysis of a draft genome assembly and extensive transcriptomic dataset for H. contortus. This represents the first genome to be published for a strongylid nematode and the most extensive transcriptomic dataset for any parasitic nematode reported to date. We show a general pattern of conservation of genome structure and gene content between H. contortus and C. elegans, but also a dramatic expansion of important parasite gene families. We identify genes involved in parasite-specific pathways such as blood feeding, neurological function, and drug metabolism. In particular, we describe complete gene repertoires for known drug target families, providing the most comprehensive understanding yet of the action of several important anthelmintics. Also, we identify a set of genes enriched in the parasitic stages of the lifecycle and the parasite gut that provide a rich source of vaccine and drug target candidates. Conclusions: The H. contortus genome and transcriptome provide an essential platform for postgenomic research in this and other important strongylid parasites.},

However, this approach captures only a static snapshot at a point in time, posing a challenge for the analysis of time-resolved phenomena such as embryogenesis or tissue regeneration. Here we show that RNA velocity-the time derivative of the gene expression state-can be directly estimated by distinguishing between unspliced and spliced mRNAs in common single-cell RNA sequencing protocols. RNA velocity is a high-dimensional vector that predicts the future state of individual cells on a timescale of hours. We validate its accuracy in the neural crest lineage, demonstrate its use on multiple published datasets and technical platforms, reveal the branching lineage tree of the developing mouse hippocampus, and examine the kinetics of transcription in human embryonic brain. We expect RNA velocity to greatly aid the analysis of developmental lineages and cellular dynamics, particularly in humans.},

  abstract = {Chromatin influences gene expression by restricting access of DNA binding proteins to their cognate sites in the genome. Large-scale characterization of nucleosome positioning in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has revealed a stereotyped promoter organization in which a nucleosome-free region (NFR) is present within several hundred base pairs upstream of the translation start site. Many transcription factors bind within NFRs and nucleate chromatin remodelling events which then expose other cis-regulatory elements. However, it is not clear how transcription-factor binding and chromatin influence quantitative attributes of gene expression. Here we show that nucleosomes function largely to decouple the threshold of induction from dynamic range. With a series of variants of one promoter, we establish that the affinity of exposed binding sites is a primary determinant of the level of physiological stimulus necessary for substantial gene activation, and sites located within nucleosomal regions serve to scale expression once chromatin is remodelled. Furthermore, we find that the S. cerevisiae phosphate response (PHO) pathway exploits these promoter designs to tailor gene expression to different environmental phosphate levels. Our results suggest that the interplay of chromatin and binding-site affinity provides a mechanism for fine-tuning responses to the same cellular state. Moreover, these findings may be a starting point for more detailed models of eukaryotic transcriptional control.},

Multiple competing technologies have been developed to improve the quality and robustness of genome assemblies during the past decade.

We applied the 2 up-to-date platforms to a single rice individual and then compared the 2 assemblies to investigate the advantages and limitations of each.The results showed that ONT ultralong reads delivered higher contiguity, producing a total of 18 contigs of which 10 were assembled into a single chromosome compared to 394 contigs and 3 chromosome-level contigs for the PacBio assembly. The ONT ultralong reads also prevented assembly errors caused by long repetitive regions, for which we observed a total of 44 genes of false redundancies and 10 genes of false losses in the PacBio assembly, leading to over- or underestimation of the gene families in those long repetitive regions. We also noted that the PacBio HiFi reads generated assemblies with considerably fewer errors at the level of single nucleotides and small insertions and deletions than those of the ONT assembly, which generated an average 1.06 errors per kb and finally engendered 1,475 incorrect gene annotations via altered or truncated protein predictions.It shows that both PacBio HiFi reads and ONT ultralong reads had their own merits. Further genome reference constructions could leverage both techniques to lessen the impact of assembly errors and subsequent annotation mistakes rooted in each.},

Our approach combines the robustness of trajectory inference with directional information from RNA velocity, taking into account the gradual and stochastic nature of cellular fate decisions, as well as uncertainty in velocity vectors. On pancreas development data, CellRank automatically detects initial, intermediate and terminal populations, predicts fate potentials and visualizes continuous gene expression trends along individual lineages. Applied to lineage-traced cellular reprogramming data, predicted fate probabilities correctly recover reprogramming outcomes. CellRank also predicts a new dedifferentiation trajectory during postinjury lung regeneration, including previously unknown intermediate cell states, which we confirm experimentally.},

  abstract = {Background: Standard preprocessing of single-cell RNA-seq UMI data includes normalization by sequencing depth to remove this technical variability, and nonlinear transformation to stabilize the variance across genes with different expression levels. Instead, two recent papers propose to use statistical count models for these tasks: Hafemeister and Satija (Genome Biol 20:296, 2019) recommend using Pearson residuals from negative binomial regression, while Townes et al. (Genome Biol 20:295, 2019) recommend fitting a generalized PCA model. Here, we investigate the connection between these approaches theoretically and empirically, and compare their effects on downstream processing. Results: We show that the model of Hafemeister and Satija produces noisy parameter estimates because it is overspecified, which is why the original paper employs post hoc smoothing. When specified more parsimoniously, it has a simple analytic solution equivalent to the rank-one Poisson GLM-PCA of Townes et al. Further, our analysis indicates that per-gene overdispersion estimates in Hafemeister and Satija are biased, and that the data are in fact consistent with the overdispersion parameter being independent of gene expression. We then use negative control data without biological variability to estimate the technical overdispersion of UMI counts, and find that across several different experimental protocols, the data are close to Poisson and suggest very moderate overdispersion. Finally, we perform a benchmark to compare the performance of Pearson residuals, variance-stabilizing transformations, and GLM-PCA on scRNA-seq datasets with known ground truth. Conclusions: We demonstrate that analytic Pearson residuals strongly outperform other methods for identifying biologically variable genes, and capture more of the biologically meaningful variation when used for dimensionality reduction.},

The device has a low capital cost, is by far the most portable DNA sequencer available, and can produce data in real-time. It has numerous prospective applications including improving genome sequence assemblies and resolution of repeat-rich regions. Before such a technology is widely adopted, it is important to assess its performance and limitations in respect of throughput and accuracy. In this study we assessed the performance of the MinION by re-sequencing three bacterial genomes, with very different nucleotide compositions ranging from 28.6\% to 70.7\%; the high G+C strain was underrepresented in the sequencing reads. We estimate the error rate of the MinION (after base calling) to be 38.2\%. Mean and median read lengths were 2kb and 1kb respectively, while the longest single read was 98kb. The whole length of a 5kb rRNA operon was covered by a single read. As the first nanopore-based single molecule sequencer available to researchers, the MinION is an exciting prospect; however, the current error rate limits its ability to compete with existing sequencing technologies, though we do show that MinION sequence reads can enhance contiguity of de novo assembly when used in conjunction with Illumina MiSeq data.},

The cumulative evidence has pointed to the key role of the intestinal barrier and the breakdown of these mechanisms in IBD. More and more scientists and clinicians are embracing the concept of the impaired intestinal epithelial barrier and its role in the pathogenesis and natural history of IBD. However, we are missing a key tool that bridges these scientific insights to clinical practice. Our goal is to overcome the limitations in understanding the molecular physiology of intestinal barrier function and develop a clinical tool to assess and quantify it. This review article explores the proteins in the intestinal tissue that are pivotal in regulating intestinal permeability. Understanding the molecular pathophysiology of impaired intestinal barrier function in IBD may lead to the development of a biochemical method of assessing intestinal tissue integrity which will have a significant impact on the development of novel therapies targeting the intestinal mucosa.},

  abstract = {Depression and fatigue are conditions responsible for heavy global societal burden, especially in patients already suffering from chronic diseases. These symptoms have been identified by those affected as some of the most disabling symptoms which affect the quality of life and productivity of the individual. While many factors play a role in the development of depression and fatigue, both have been associated with increased inflammatory activation of the immune system affecting both the periphery and the central nervous system (CNS). This is further supported by the well-described association between diseases that involve immune activation and these symptoms in autoimmune disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and immune system activation in response to infections, like sepsis. Treatments for depression also support this immunopsychiatric link. Antidepressants have been shown to decrease inflammation, while higher levels of baseline inflammation predict lower treatment efficacy for most treatments. Those patients with higher initial immune activation may on the other hand be more responsive to treatments targeting immune pathways, which have been found to be effective in treating depression and fatigue in some cases. These results show strong support for the hypothesis that depression and fatigue are associated with an increased activation of the immune system which may serve as a valid target for treatment. Further studies should focus on the pathways involved in these symptoms and the development of treatments that target those pathways will help us to better understand these conditions and devise more targeted treatments.},

Inflammation is a driving factor both in inflammatory bowel disease and cancer, but the mechanism underlying the transition from colon inflammation to cancer remains to be defined. Dysregulation of mucosal glycosylation has been described as a key regulatory mechanism associated both with colon inflammation and colorectal cancer development. In this review, we discuss the major molecular mechanisms of colitis-associated cancer pathogenesis, highlighting the role of glycans expressed at gut epithelial cells, at lamina propria T cells, and in serum proteins in the regulation of intestinal inflammation and its progression to colon cancer, further discussing its potential clinical and therapeutic applications.Colitis-associated cancer (CAC) is a major complication of inflammatory bowel disease and the molecular mechanisms underlying CAC progression are still elusive. Protein glycosylation holds a great promise for improving the understanding of CAC immunopathogenesis, opening new avenues for clinical and therapeutic interventions.},

To infer phylodynamic spread in time and space we employ a recently developed Bayesian statistical inference framework (Lemey et al., in press). We model spatial diffusion as a continuous-time Markov chain process along time-measured genealogies. In this analysis, we consider 40 locations for which sequence data were available on 06-Aug-2009. The sampling time interval of the 242 sequences spans from 30-Mar-2009 to 12-Jul-2009. The Bayesian inference typically results in a posterior distribution of phylogenetic trees, each having an estimate of the epidemic locations at the ancestral nodes in the tree. We summarize these trees using the most representative clustering pattern and annotate these clusters with the most probable location states. We can visualize this information as tree that grows over time, seeding locations each time an ancestral node is inferred to exist at a different location. A Bayes factor test provides statistical support for epidemiological linkage throughout the evolutionary history. We demonstrate how our full probabilistic approach efficiently tracks an epidemic based on viral genetic data as it unfolds across the globe.},

  abstract = {Information on global human movement patterns is central to spatial epidemiological models used to predict the behavior of influenza and other infectious diseases. Yet it remains difficult to test which modes of dispersal drive pathogen spread at various geographic scales using standard epidemiological data alone. Evolutionary analyses of pathogen genome sequences increasingly provide insights into the spatial dynamics of influenza viruses, but to date they have largely neglected the wealth of information on human mobility, mainly because no statistical framework exists within which viral gene sequences and empirical data on host movement can be combined. Here, we address this problem by applying a phylogeographic approach to elucidate the global spread of human influenza subtype H3N2 and assess its ability to predict the spatial spread of human influenza A viruses worldwide. Using a framework that estimates the migration history of human influenza while simultaneously testing and quantifying a range of potential predictive variables of spatial spread, we show that the global dynamics of influenza H3N2 are driven by air passenger flows, whereas at more local scales spread is also determined by processes that correlate with geographic distance. Our analyses further confirm a central role for mainland China and Southeast Asia in maintaining a source population for global influenza diversity. By comparing model output with the known pandemic expansion of H1N1 during 2009, we demonstrate that predictions of influenza spatial spread are most accurate when data on human mobility and viral evolution are integrated. In conclusion, the global dynamics of influenza viruses are best explained by combining human mobility data with the spatial information inherent in sampled viral genomes. The integrated approach introduced here offers great potential for epidemiological surveillance through phylogeographic reconstructions and for improving predictive models of disease control.},

This extends to the Hedgehog pathway, which primarily serves to counter GLI repression by processing GLI proteins into transcriptional activators. In investigating the mechanisms underlying GLI repression, we find that a subset of GLI binding regions, termed HH-responsive enhancers, specifically loses acetylation in the absence of HH signaling. These regions are highly enriched around HH target genes and primarily drive HH-specific transcriptional activity in the mouse limb bud. They also retain H3K27ac enrichment in limb buds devoid of GLI activator and repressor, indicating that their activity is primarily regulated by GLI repression. Furthermore, the Polycomb repression complex is not active at most of these regions, suggesting it is not a major mechanism of GLI repression. We propose a model for tissue-specific enhancer activity in which an HDAC-associated GLI repression complex regulates target genes by altering the acetylation status at enhancers.},

Quantitative mass spectrometry on the same cell populations identified 278 proteins enriched in intestinal stem cells. The mRNA and protein data sets showed a high level of correlation and a combined signature of 510 stem cell-enriched genes was defined. Spatial expression patterns were further characterized by mRNA in-situ hybridization, revealing that approximately half of the genes were expressed in a gradient with highest levels at the crypt bottom, while the other half was expressed uniquely in Lgr5+stem cells. Lineage tracing using a newly established knock-in mouse for one of the signature genes, Smoc2, confirmed its stem cell specificity.

This biologically heterogeneous disease results in diverse therapeutic responses, thus, novel prognostic biomarkers are required to improve CRC treatment.

The present study aimed to investigate the expression of ERR{$\alpha$} in patients with CRC, and explore the association between ERR{$\alpha$} expression and clinicopathological factors, local recurrence and prognosis. In the present study, ERR{$\alpha$} expression was detected in 15 fresh CRC tissues using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and in 128 paraffin-embedded CRC tissues using immunohistochemistry. The associations between ERR{$\alpha$} expression and prognosis of CRC patients were evaluated by univariate, and multivariate (Cox proportional hazards model) analysis. RT-qPCR demonstrated that the mRNA expression of ERR{$\alpha$} in CRC tissues was significantly higher compared with that in matched normal tissues. Immunohistochemistry revealed that ERR{$\alpha$} high expression was detected in the nuclei of cancer cells from 39.1\% (50/128) of CRC tissues. ERR{$\alpha$} expression based on immunohistochemical staining was significantly associated with tumor differentiation, tumor invasion, lymph node status and Dukes stage (all P{$<$}0.05). Furthermore, patients with high ERR{$\alpha$} expression were significantly associated with an increased risk of recurrence and poor prognosis, compared with patients with low ERR{$\alpha$} expression. ERR{$\alpha$} expression was identified as an independent prognostic factor for patients with CRC. In conclusion, ERR{$\alpha$} serves important roles in the progression of CRC and is a potential prognostic factor for patients with CRC.},

These moths belong to a lineage that is thought to have split from all other Lepidoptera more than 300 Ma and are consequently vital to understanding the early evolution of superorder Amphiesmenoptera, which contains the order Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) and its sister order Trichoptera (caddisflies). Using PacBio HiFi sequencing reads, we assembled a highly contiguous genome with a contig N50 of nearly 17 Mb. The assembled genome length of 541,115,538\,bp is about half the length of the largest published Amphiesmenoptera genome (Limnephilus lunatus, Trichoptera) and double the length of the smallest (Papilio polytes, Lepidoptera). We find high recovery of universal single copy orthologs with 98.1\% of BUSCO genes present and provide a genome annotation of 15,643 genes aided by resolved isoforms from PacBio IsoSeq data. This high-quality genome assembly provides an important resource for studying ecological and evolutionary transitions in the early evolution of Amphiesmenoptera.},

CRC arises from the complex interactions among a variety of genetic and environmental factors. To understand the mechanism of colon tumorigenesis, preclinical studies have developed various mouse models including carcinogen-induced and transgenic mice to recapitulate CRC in humans. Using these mouse models, scientific breakthroughs have been made on the understanding of the pathogenesis of this complex disease. Moreover, the availability of transgenic knock-in or knock-out mice further increases the potential of CRC mouse models. In this review, the overall features of carcinogen-induced (focusing on azoxymethane and azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium) and transgenic (focusing on ApcMin/+) mouse models, as well as their mechanisms to induce colon tumorigenesis, are explored. We also discuss limitations of these mouse models and their applications in the evaluation and study of drugs and treatment regimens against CRC. Through these mouse models, a better understanding of colon tumorigenesis can be achieved, thereby facilitating the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies against CRC.},

  abstract = {Symbiotic bacteria, commonly called rhizobia, lead a saprophytic lifestyle in the soil and form nitrogen-fixing nodules on legume roots. During their lifecycle, rhizobia have to adapt to different conditions prevailing in the soils and within host plants. To survive under these conditions, rhizobia fine-tune the regulatory machinery to respond rapidly and adequately to environmental changes. Symbiotic bacteria play an essential role in the soil environment from both ecological and economical point of view, since these bacteria provide Fabaceae plants (legumes) with large amounts of accessible nitrogen as a result of symbiotic interactions (i.e., rhizobia present within the nodule reduce atmospheric dinitrogen (N2) to ammonia, which can be utilized by plants). Because of its restricted availability in the soil, nitrogen is one of the most limiting factors for plant growth. In spite of its high content in the atmosphere, plants are not able to assimilate it directly in the N2 form. During symbiosis, rhizobia infect host root and trigger the development of specific plant organ, the nodule. The aim of root nodule formation is to ensure a microaerobic environment, which is essential for proper activity of nitrogenase, i.e., a key enzyme facilitating N2 fixation. To adapt to various lifestyles and environmental stresses, rhizobia have developed several regulatory mechanisms, e.g., reversible phosphorylation. This key mechanism regulates many processes in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. In microorganisms, signal transduction includes two-component systems (TCSs), which involve membrane sensor histidine kinases (HKs) and cognate DNA-binding response regulators (RRs). Furthermore, regulatory mechanisms based on phosphoenolopyruvate-dependent phosphotranspherase systems (PTSs), as well as alternative regulatory pathways controlled by Hanks-type serine/threonine kinases (STKs) and serine/threonine phosphatases (STPs) play an important role in regulation of many cellular processes in both free-living bacteria and during symbiosis with the host plant (e.g., growth and cell division, envelope biogenesis, biofilm formation, response to stress conditions, and regulation of metabolism). In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of phosphorylation systems in symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and their role in the physiology of rhizobial cells and adaptation to various environmental conditions.},

Hence, prediction of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) provides a solid foundation for inferring gene regulatory mechanisms and building regulatory networks for a genome. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) technology can generate large-scale experimental data for such protein{\textendash}DNA interactions, providing an unprecedented opportunity to identify TFBSs (a.k.a. cis-regulatory motifs). The bottleneck, however, is the lack of robust mathematical models, as well as efficient computational methods for TFBS prediction to make effective use of massive ChIP-seq data sets in the public domain. The purpose of this study is to review existing motif-finding methods for ChIP-seq data from an algorithmic perspective and provide new computational insight into this field. The state-of-the-art methods were shown through summarizing eight representative motif-finding algorithms along with corresponding challenges, and introducing some important relative functions according to specific biological demands, including discriminative motif finding and cofactor motifs analysis. Finally, potential directions and plans for ChIP-seq-based motif-finding tools were showcased in support of future algorithm development.},

While studies have elucidated important subpopulations of intestinal epithelial cells in repair, these have yet to translate to therapies. Here, in mouse models of acute colitis, we demonstrate a distinct and essential source of wound-healing cells that re-epithelialize the distal colon. Using 3-d imaging, lineage tracing, and single-cell transcriptomics, we show that neighboring skin-like (squamous) cells of the anus rapidly migrate into the injured colon and establish a permanent epithelium of crypt-like morphology. These squamous cells derive from a small unique transition zone, at the boundary of colonic and anal epithelium, that resists colitis. The cells of this zone have a pre-loaded program of colonic differentiation and further upregulate key aspects of colonic epithelium during repair. Thus, heterologous cell-types at tissue junctions represent unique reserve cells capable of repair and plasticity.},

However, histomorphology of IBD-associated CAC has not been thoroughly examined, and it is unclear whether and how these patients should be screened for Lynch syndrome (LS). We evaluated the demographic and morphologic features of 108 IBD-associated CACs, including ulcerative colitis-associated (n = 95) and Crohn disease-associated CACs (n = 13), against 93 control cases of sporadic microsatellite-stable (MSS) CAC, 20 cases of sporadic microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) CAC, and 23 CAC cases of LS. The mean age of patients with IBD-associated CAC was 50 years, which was lower compared with the mean age of 63.7 years of the sporadic MSS controls and 76.5 years of the sporadic MSI-H group but not statistically different from that of the LS patients. Synchronous CACs were noted in 20.4\% of the IBD patients and 13\% of LS patients but in only 2.1\% of the sporadic MSS controls and in none of the MSI-H patients. Right-sided CACs were significantly less frequent in the IBD group than in sporadic MSS controls, MSI-H group, and LS patients (P {$<$} 0.05 for all). In contrast to sporadic MSS CAC, IBD-associated CACs are characterized by lack of tumor necrosis, Crohn-like reaction, tumor histologic heterogeneity, the presence of mucin, and signet ring cell differentiation and tumor well differentiation. The histomorphologic similarity among IBD-associated and MSI-H tumors, either sporadic MSI-H or LS-related, is independent of MSI status. The young age of patients with IBD-associated CAC and the morphological similarities among IBD-associated, sporadic MSI-H, and LS-related CAC suggest that an age-based and morphology-based strategy before the screening test for LS may be less effective in IBD patients than in the non-IBD population.},

Despite these recent medical advances, complete sustained remission of disease remains elusive for most patients. The full healing of the damaged intestinal mucosa is the primary goal of all therapies. Achieving this requires not just a reduction of the aberrant immunological response, but also wound healing of the epithelium. No currently approved therapy directly targets the epithelium. Epithelial repair is compromised in IBD and normally facilitates re-establishment of the homeostatic barrier between the host and the microbiome. In this review, we summarize the evidence that epithelial wound healing represents an important yet underdeveloped therapeutic modality for IBD. We highlight 3 general approaches that are promising for developing a new class of epithelium-targeted therapies: epithelial stem cells, cytokines, and microbiome engineering. We also provide a frank discussion of some of the challenges that must be overcome for epithelial repair to be therapeutically leveraged. A concerted approach by the field to develop new therapies targeting epithelial wound healing will offer patients a game-changing, complementary class of medications and could dramatically improve outcomes.},

  abstract = {The intestinal epithelium possesses a great capacity of self-renewal under normal homeostatic conditions and of regeneration upon damages. The renewal and regenerative processes are driven by intestinal stem cells (ISCs), which reside at the base of crypts and are marked by Lgr5. As Lgr5+ ISCs undergo fast cycling and are vulnerable to damages, there must be other types of cells that can replenish the lost Lgr5+ ISCs and then regenerate the damage epithelium. In addition to Lgr5+ ISCs, quiescent ISCs at the +\,4 position in the crypt have been proposed to convert to Lgr5+ ISCs during regeneration. However, this ``reserve stem cell'' model still remains controversial. Different from the traditional view of a hierarchical organization of the intestinal epithelium, recent works support the dynamic ``dedifferentiation'' model, in which various cell types within the epithelium can de-differentiate to revert to the stem cell state and then regenerate the epithelium upon tissue injury. Here, we provide an overview of the cell identity and features of two distinct models and discuss the possible mechanisms underlying the intestinal epithelial plasticity.},

Despite the importance of Hippo signaling in tumorigenesis, Tead-dependent downstream oncogenic programs and target genes in cancer cells remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize Tead4mediated transcriptional networks in a diverse range of cancer cells, including neuroblastoma, colorectal, lung, and endometrial carcinomas. By intersecting genome-wide chromatin occupancy analyses of Tead4, JunD, and Fra1/2, we find that Tead4 cooperates with AP1 transcription factors to coordinate target gene transcription. We find that Tead-AP1 interaction is JNK independent but engages the SRC1{\textendash}3 co-activators to promote downstream transcription. Furthermore, we show that Tead-AP1 cooperation regulates the activity of the Dock-Rac/CDC42 module and drives the expression of a unique core set of target genes, thereby directing cell migration and invasion. Together, our data unveil a critical regulatory mechanism underlying Tead- and AP1-controlled transcriptional and functional outputs in cancer cells.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Epithelial wound healing is compromised and represents an unleveraged therapeutic target in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Intestinal epithelial cells exhibit plasticity that facilitates dedifferentiation and repair during the response to injury. However, it is not known whether epithelial cells of a neighboring organ can be activated to mediate re-epithelialization in acute colitis. Histological findings of a permanent squamous tissue structure in the distal colon in human IBD could suggest diverse cellular origins of repair-associated epithelium. Here, we tested whether skin-like cells from the anus mediate colonic re-epithelialization in murine~colitis. METHODS: We studied dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis and interleukin 10-deficient colitis in transgenic mice. We performed lineage tracing, 3-dimensional (3D) imaging, single-cell transcriptomics, and biophysical modeling to map squamous cell fates and to identify squamous cell types involved in colonic repair. RESULTS: In acute and chronic colitis, we found a large squamous epithelium, called squamous neo-epithelium of the colon (SNEC), near the anorectal junction. Neighboring squamous cells of the anus rapidly migrate into the ulcerated colon and establish this permanent epithelium of crypt-like morphology. These squamous cells derive from a small unique transition zone, distal to the border of colonic and anal epithelium, that resists colitic injury. The cells of this zone have a pre-loaded program of colonic differentiation and further upregulate key aspects of colonic epithelium during repair. CONCLUSION: Transitional anal cells represent unique reserve cells capable of rebuilding epithelial structures in the colon after colitis. Further study of these cells could reveal novel approaches to direct mucosal healing in inflammation and disease.},

The large number of Ebola survivors has highlighted the frequency of persistent symptoms and the possibility of virus persistence in sanctuary sites, sometimes leading to delayed transmission.

Using examples from mouse brain, pancreas, immune and whole-organism atlases, we show that scArches preserves biological state information while removing batch effects, despite using four orders of magnitude fewer parameters than de novo integration. scArches generalizes to multimodal reference mapping, allowing imputation of missing modalities. Finally, scArches retains coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease variation when mapping to a healthy reference, enabling the discovery of disease-specific cell states. scArches will facilitate collaborative projects by enabling iterative construction, updating, sharing and efficient use of reference atlases.},

In the resolution phase of colonic inflammation, adaptive Th17 cells are the major source of IL-17A, however, the cell-specific temporal control mechanism(s) underlying the delayed Th17 response remain elusive. Here, we discover a surprising role of the lncRNA Malat1 as a key barrier to achieving a robust and protective Th17 response. Genetic ablation of Malat1 potentiates IL-17A production in Th17 cells and improves disease outcomes in mouse models of colitis. Mechanistically, Malat1 represses Il17a transcription by restricting its bivalent super-enhancer activities. Thus, Malat1 is down-regulated during the resolution phase of inflammation, allowing Th17 to overtake early Tgd17 as the major source of colonic IL-17A. Targeted depletion of Malat1 in T helper cell using anti-sense nucleotides show therapeutic potential in colitis model.},

  abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease-related colorectal cancer (IBD-CRC) is one of the most serious complications of IBD contributing to significant mortality in this cohort of patients. IBD is often associated with diet and lifestyle-related gut microbial dysbiosis, the interaction of genetic and environmental factors, leading to chronic gut inflammation. According to the "common ground hypothesis", microbial dysbiosis and intestinal barrier impairment are at the core of the chronic inflammatory process associated with IBD-CRC. Among the many underlying factors known to increase the risk of IBD-CRC, perhaps the most important factor is chronic persistent inflammation. The persistent inflammation in the colon results in increased proliferation of cells necessary for repair but this also increases the risk of dysplastic changes due to chromosomal and microsatellite instability. Multiple pathways have been identified, regulated by many positive and negative factors involved in the development of cancer, which in this case follows the 'inflammation-dysplasia-carcinoma' sequence. Strategies to lower this risk are extremely important to reduce morbidity and mortality due to IBD-CRC, among which colonoscopic surveillance is the most widely accepted and implemented modality, forming part of many national and international guidelines. However, the effectiveness of surveillance in IBD has been a topic of much debate in recent years for multiple reasons - cost-benefit to health systems, resource requirements, and also because of studies showing conflicting long-term data. Our review provides a comprehensive overview of past, present, and future perspectives of IBD-CRC. We explore and analyse evidence from studies over decades and current best practices followed globally. In the future directions section, we cover emerging novel endoscopic techniques and artificial intelligence that could play an important role in managing the risk of IBD-CRC.},

Previously, using sequencing of isolated Bs of ruminants and rodents, we demonstrated that Bs originate as segmental duplications of specific genomic regions, and subsequently experience pseudogenization and repeat accumulation. Here, we used a similar approach to characterize Bs of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes L.) and the Chinese raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides procyonoides Gray). We confirm the previous findings of the KIT gene on Bs of both species, but demostrate an independent origin of Bs in these species, with two reused regions. Comparison of gene ensembles in Bs of canids, ruminants, and rodents once again indicates enrichment with cell-cycle genes, development-related genes, and genes functioning in the neuron synapse. The presence of B-chromosomal copies of genes involved in cell-cycle regulation and tissue differentiation may indicate importance of these genes for B chromosome establishment.},

To test if an alternative model may help reconcile these perspectives, we studied the hierarchical organization of crypt epithelial cells in an unbiased fashion, by combining high-resolution, single-cell profiling and lineage tracing in multiple transgenic mouse models. These show that Lgr5 is not a specific ISC marker; rather, cells located in the crypt isthmus, which include Lgr5low cells, comprise the ISCs that sustain tissue homeostasis. Following irradiation or intestinal injury, surviving ISCs and progenitors, but not differentiated cells, participate in intestinal regeneration, suggesting that neither de-differentiation nor reserve stem cell populations are drivers of intestinal regeneration. Our results provide a novel viewpoint for the intestinal crypt epithelium, in which ISCs localize to the crypt isthmus, and ISC potential is restricted to stem and progenitor cells.},

They provide a physical framework for mapping additional sequences, thereby enabling characterization of, for example, genomic diversity and differences in gene expression across individuals and tissue types. Quality metrics for genome assemblies gauge both the completeness and contiguity of an assembly and help provide confidence in downstream biological insights. To compare quality across multiple assemblies, a set of common metrics are typically calculated and then compared to one or more gold standard reference genomes. While several tools exist for calculating individual metrics, applications providing comprehensive evaluations of multiple assembly features are, perhaps surprisingly, lacking. Here, we describe a new toolkit that integrates multiple metrics to characterize both assembly and gene annotation quality in a way that enables comparison across multiple assemblies and assembly types.},

  abstract = {In this project we solved the ``Motif finding'' problem using two different approches to the problem: as a learning problem based on an HMM model and as a search problem. We used two different methods. The first one is the Expectation Maximization (E.M.) algorithm, which is an iterative learning algorithm for learning the parameters that maximize the likelihood of a statistical model with partial data. We used a model that treats the motif finding problem as an HMM (Hidden Markov Model). This is a well known method for motif finding, also known as the MEME algorithm. The second is the Genetic Algorithm, a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural selection ,in order to find the optimal solution to a search problem. We wanted to see if the genetic algorithm will evolve to a similar solution to the one generated by the EM algorithm .Moreover, we were hoping that the genetic algorithm will be able to handle 'local maxima' cases better than the EM algorithm. We got suprisingly similar solutions for both of these methods when working with short DNA sequences. However, for longer sequences we found it harder to judge due to the costly runtime of the genetic algorithm.},

  abstract = {Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a stromal cell population with cell-of-origin, phenotypic and functional heterogeneity, are the most essential components of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Through multiple pathways, activated CAFs can promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, along with extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and even chemoresistance. Numerous previous studies have confirmed the critical role of the interaction between CAFs and tumor cells in tumorigenesis and development. However, recently, the mutual effects of CAFs and the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) have been identified as another key factor in promoting tumor progression. The TIME mainly consists of distinct immune cell populations in tumor islets and is highly associated with the antitumor immunological state in the TME. CAFs interact with tumor-infiltrating immune cells as well as other immune components within the TIME via the secretion of various cytokines, growth factors, chemokines, exosomes and other effector molecules, consequently shaping an immunosuppressive TME that enables cancer cells to evade surveillance of the immune system. In-depth studies of CAFs and immune microenvironment interactions, particularly the complicated mechanisms connecting CAFs with immune cells, might provide novel strategies for subsequent targeted immunotherapies. Herein, we shed light on recent advances regarding the direct and indirect crosstalk between CAFs and infiltrating immune cells and further summarize the possible immunoinhibitory mechanisms induced by CAFs in the TME. In addition, we present current related CAF-targeting immunotherapies and briefly describe some future perspectives on CAF research in the end.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) increases intestinal epithelial cell shedding and apoptosis, potentially challenging the barrier between the gastrointestinal lumen and internal tissues. We investigated the mechanism of tight junction remodeling and barrier maintenance as well as the roles of cytoskeletal regulatory molecules during TNF-induced shedding. METHODS: We studied wild-type and transgenic mice that express the fluorescent-tagged proteins enhanced green fluorescent protein-occludin or monomeric red fluorescent protein 1-ZO-1. After injection of high doses of TNF (7.5 {$\mu$}g intraperitoneally), laparotomies were performed and segments of small intestine were opened to visualize the mucosa by video confocal microscopy. Pharmacologic inhibitors and knockout mice were used to determine the roles of caspase activation, actomyosin, and microtubule remodeling and membrane trafficking in epithelial shedding. RESULTS: Changes detected included redistribution of the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin to lateral membranes of shedding cells. These proteins ultimately formed a funnel around the shedding cell that defined the site of barrier preservation. Claudins, E-cadherin, F-actin, myosin II, Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) were also recruited to lateral membranes. Caspase activity, myosin motor activity, and microtubules were required to initiate shedding, whereas completion of the process required microfilament remodeling and ROCK, MLCK, and dynamin II activities. CONCLUSIONS: Maintenance of the epithelial barrier during TNF-induced cell shedding is a complex process that involves integration of microtubules, microfilaments, and membrane traffic to remove apoptotic cells. This process is accompanied by redistribution of apical junctional complex proteins to form intercellular barriers between lateral membranes and maintain mucosal function.},

Current advances in sequencing technologies press for the development of faster pairwise alignment algorithms that can scale with increasing read lengths and production yields.In this article, we present the wavefront alignment algorithm (WFA), an exact gap-affine algorithm that takes advantage of homologous regions between the sequences to accelerate the alignment process. As opposed to traditional dynamic programming algorithms that run in quadratic time, the WFA runs in time O(ns), proportional to the read length n and the alignment score s, using O(s2) memory. Furthermore, our algorithm exhibits simple data dependencies that can be easily vectorized, even by the automatic features of modern compilers, for different architectures, without the need to adapt the code. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm, together with other state-of-the-art implementations. As a result, we demonstrate that the WFA runs 20{\textendash}300{\texttimes} faster than other methods aligning short Illumina-like sequences, and 10{\textendash}100{\texttimes} faster using long noisy reads like those produced by Oxford Nanopore Technologies.The WFA algorithm is implemented within the wavefront-aligner library, and it is publicly available at https://github.com/smarco/WFA.},

  abstract = {Fibroblasts are the most abundant ``non-cancerous'' cells in tumors. However, it remains largely unknown how these cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote tumor growth and metastasis, driving chemotherapy resistance and poor clinical outcome. This review summarizes new findings on CAF signaling pathways and their emerging metabolic phenotypes that promote tumor growth. Although it is well established that altered cancer metabolism enhances tumor growth, little is known about the role of fibroblast metabolism in tumor growth. New studies reveal that metabolic coupling occurs between catabolic fibroblasts and anabolic cancer cells, in many types of human tumors, including breast, prostate, and head \& neck cancers, as well as lymphomas. These catabolic phenotypes observed in CAFs are secondary to a ROS-induced metabolic stress response. Mechanistically, this occurs via HIF1-alpha and NF{$\kappa$}B signaling, driving oxidative stress, autophagy, glycolysis and senescence in stromal fibroblasts. These catabolic CAFs then create a nutrient-rich microenvironment, to metabolically support tumor growth, via the local stromal generation of mitochondrial fuels (lactate, ketone bodies, fatty acids, glutamine, and other amino acids). New biomarkers of this catabolic CAF phenotype (such as caveolin-1 (Cav-1) and MCT4), which are reversible upon treatment with anti-oxidants, are strong predictors of poor clinical outcome in various types of human cancers. How cancer cells metabolically reprogram fibroblasts can also help us to understand the effects of cancer cells at an organismal level, explaining para-neoplastic phenomena, such as cancer cachexia. In conclusion, cancer should be viewed more as a systemic disease, that engages the host-organism in various forms of energy-transfer and metabolic co-operation, across a whole-body ``ecosystem''.},

  abstract = {Most speciation events probably occur gradually, without complete and immediate reproductive isolation, but the full extent of gene flow between diverging species has rarely been characterized on a genome-wide scale. Documenting the extent and timing of admixture between diverging species can clarify the role of geographic isolation in speciation. Here we use new methodology to quantify admixture at different stages of divergence in Heliconius butterflies, based on whole genome sequences of 31 individuals. Comparisons between sympatric and allopatric populations of H. melpomene, H. cydno and H. timareta revealed a genome-wide trend of increased shared variation in sympatry, indicative of pervasive interspecific gene flow. Up to 40\% of 100 kb genomic windows clustered by geography rather than by species, demonstrating that a very substantial fraction of the genome has been shared between sympatric species. Analyses of genetic variation shared over different time intervals suggested that admixture between these species has continued since early in speciation. Alleles shared between species during recent time intervals displayed higher levels of linkage disequilibrium than those shared over longer time intervals, suggesting that this admixture took place at multiple points during divergence and is probably ongoing. The signal of admixture was significantly reduced around loci controlling divergent wing patterns, as well as throughout the Z chromosome, consistent with strong selection for M{\"u}llerian mimicry and with known Z-linked hybrid incompatibility. Overall these results show that species divergence can occur in the face of persistent and genome-wide admixture over long periods of time.},

  abstract = {Pre-B-cell leukaemia (PBX) is a transcription factor family (PBX1, PBX2, PBX3 and PBX4) that regulates important cellular functions and has been identified to be involved in human cancers. This study aimed to explore the expression of PBX genes and their clinical significance in colorectal cancer (CRC). We analysed the differential expression of PBX genes in CRC vs. normal tissue, using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) and ONCOMINE platform (https://www.oncomine.org/). The UALCAN (http://ualcan.path.uab.edu/) interactive OMICS web-server was used to evaluate the epigenetic regulation of PBX genes via their promoter methylation status. We found that only PBX4 was upregulated whereas PBX1 and PBX3 were downregulated (644 tumour vs. 51 normal samples) (P{$<$}0.001). The methylation status of PBX4 promoter appeared to be decreased (P=1.4e-07) whereas the methylation status of PBX1 and PBX3 promoters was increased (P=3.8e-04 and P=3.2e-07, respectively) in cancer vs. normal samples. To determine the prognostic value of PBXs, we conducted a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariable COX regression. We observed that high PBX4 expression was associated with increased risk for a worse overall survival (OS) in the TCGA CRC patient cohort (n=639), (HR 1.46, 95\% CI 1.14-1.88, P=0.003) adjusted for age, gender, tumour location and metastases. We conducted in vitro gene expression modulation experiments to investigate the impact of PBX4 overexpression in CRC cell (HCT116) growth. Additionally, we evaluated the RNA expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis markers. In vitro studies showed that PBX4 overexpression increased CRC cell proliferation (P{$<$}0.001) and upregulated the expression of EMT markers VIM, CDH1, CDH2, ZEB1, SNAI1 (P{$<$}0.05) and angiomarker VEGFA (P{$<$}0.0001). Lastly, through the Cistrome data browser (http://dbtoolkit.cistrome.org/) we investigated putative transcriptional regulators and we performed gene set enrichment analysis in Enrichr server (https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/) to identify related biological processes. Nineteen factors were identified to be putative regulators of PBX4 and gene set enrichment analysis showed that biological processes related to cell cycle and cell proliferation were enriched (GO:0051726: CDK8, JUN, JUND, and IRF1, P=0.001). In conclusion, our study identified PBX4 as a potential novel oncopromoter in CRC and its overexpression was found to be associated with increased risk for worse survival rate.},

However, in the last few years, mosaic TRs composed of different units have been found to be associated with several brain disorders by long-read sequencing techniques. Mosaic TRs are difficult-to-characterize sequence configurations that are usually confirmed by manual inspection. Widely used tools are not designed to solve the mosaic TR problem and often fail to properly decompose mosaic TRs.                                         Results               We propose an efficient algorithm that can decompose mosaic tandem repeats in the input string with high sensitivity. Using synthetic benchmark data, we demonstrate that our program named uTR outperforms TRF and RepeatMasker in terms of prediction accuracy, this is especially true when mosaic TRs are more complex, and uTR is faster than TRF and RepeatMasker in most cases.

The mammalian cell division cycle is tightly controlled to ensure complete and precise genome duplication and segregation of replicated chromosomes to daughter cells. The onset of DNA replication marks an irreversible commitment to cell division, and the accumulated efforts of many decades of molecular and cellular studies have probed this cellular decision, commonly called the restriction point. Despite a long-standing conceptual framework of the restriction point for progression through G1 phase into S phase or exit from G1 phase to quiescence (G0), recent technical advances in quantitative single cell analysis of mammalian cells have provided new insights. Significant intercellular heterogeneity revealed by single cell studies and the discovery of discrete subpopulations in proliferating cultures suggests the need for an even more nuanced understanding of cell proliferation decisions. In this review, we describe some of the recent developments in the cell cycle field made possible by quantitative single cell experimental approaches.},

We have evaluated the method using simulated data, a dataset from a quality control experiment for microarrays and data from a biological experiment investigating histone deacetylase inhibitors. When the magnitude of differential expression is taken into account, TREAT improves upon the false discovery rate of existing methods and identifies more biologically relevant genes., Availability: R code implementing our methods is contributed to the software package limma available at http://www.bioconductor.org., Contact: smyth@wehi.edu.au},

Establishing a high-quality genome for this species has specific cultural importance to M{\=a}ori and commercial importance to honey producers in Aotearoa. Assemblies were produced by five long read assemblers using data subsampled based on read lengths, two polishing strategies and two Hi-C mapping methods. Our results from subsampling the data by read length showed that each assembler tested performed differently depending on the coverage and the read length of the data. Subsampling highlighted that input data with longer read lengths but perhaps lower coverage constructed more contiguous, kmers and gene-complete assemblies than short read length input data with higher coverage. The final genome assembly was constructed into 14 pseudochromosomes using an initial flye long read assembly, a racon/medaka/pilon combined polishing strategy, salsa2 and allhic scaffolding, juicebox curation, and Macadamia linkage map validation. We highlighted the importance of developing assembly workflows based on the volume and read length of sequencing data and established a robust set of quality metrics for generating high-quality assemblies. Scaffolding analyses highlighted that problems found in the initial assemblies could not be resolved accurately by Hi-C data and that assembly scaffolding was more successful when the underlying contig assembly was of higher accuracy. These findings provide insight into how quality assessment tools can be implemented throughout genome assembly pipelines to inform the de novo reconstruction of a high-quality genome assembly for nonmodel organisms.},

We analyzed nine cancer types to determine the subclonal frequencies of driver events, to time mutational processes during cancer evolution, and to identify drivers of subclonal expansions. Although mutations in known driver genes typically occurred early in cancer evolution, we also identified later subclonal "actionable" mutations, including BRAF (V600E), IDH1 (R132H), PIK3CA (E545K), EGFR (L858R), and KRAS (G12D), which may compromise the efficacy of targeted therapy approaches. More than 20\% of IDH1 mutations in glioblastomas, and 15\% of mutations in genes in the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)-AKT-mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling axis across all tumor types were subclonal. Mutations in the RAS-MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase) signaling axis were less likely to be subclonal than mutations in genes associated with PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling. Analysis of late mutations revealed a link between APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis and the acquisition of subclonal driver mutations and uncovered putative cancer genes involved in subclonal expansions, including CTNNA2 and ATXN1. Our results provide a pan-cancer census of driver events within the context of intratumor heterogeneity and reveal patterns of tumor evolution across cancers. The frequent presence of subclonal driver mutations suggests the need to stratify targeted therapy response according to the proportion of tumor cells in which the driver is identified.},

  abstract = {Cancer metastasis is a significant challenge in colorectal cancer (CRC) therapy. SET and MYND domain-containing protein 2 (SMYD2) is highly expressed in multiple cancers but is rarely studied in CRC. This study aims to identify whether abnormal expression of SMYD2 is associated with cancer metastasis in CRC. In this study, we demonstrated that SMYD2 not only promoted cell proliferation but also increased the metastatic ability of CRC. The expression of adenomatous polyposis coli 2 (APC2), an inhibitor of the Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin pathway, was suppressed by SMYD2 overexpression. Overexpression of SMYD2 activated the Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin pathway and then induced the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program in CRC. Mechanistically, low APC2 expression in CRC cells was due to SMYD2-mediated DNA methylation modification. This modification might require synergism with DNMT1. In summary, our study provides new insights into SMYD2-related transcriptional regulation patterns and indicates that SMYD2 could be a potential therapeutic target for CRC patients.},

Importantly, intestinal homeostasis can be maintained after depletion of Lgr5(+) cells due to the activation of Lgr5(-) reserve ISCs. The Lgr5(-) ISC populations are thought to play a similar role during intestinal regeneration following radiation-induced damage. We tested this regeneration hypothesis by combining depletion of Lgr5(+) ISCs with radiation exposure. In contrast to the negligible effect of Lgr5(+) ISC loss during homeostasis, depletion of Lgr5(+) cells during radiation-induced damage and subsequent repair caused catastrophic crypt loss and deterioration of crypt-villus architecture. Interestingly though, we found that crypts deficient for Lgr5(+) cells are competent to undergo hyperplasia upon loss of Apc. These data argue that Lgr5(-) reserve stem cells are radiosensitive and that Lgr5(+) cells are crucial for robust intestinal regeneration following radiation exposure but are dispensable for premalignant hyperproliferation.},

We previously reported that type I interferon (IFN), which is essential for host antiviral responses, is a physiological stressor for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and small intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and that interferon regulatory factor-2 (IRF2), which attenuates IFN signaling, maintains their stemness. Here, using a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis model, we explore the role of IRF2 in maintaining colonic epithelial stem cells (CoSCs). In mice with a conditional Irf2 deletion in the intestinal epithelium (hereafter Irf2{$\Delta$}IEC mice), both the number and the organoid-forming potential of CoSCs were markedly reduced. Consistent with this finding, the ability of Irf2{$\Delta$}IEC mice to regenerate colon epithelium after inducing colitis was severely impaired, independently of microbial dysbiosis. Mechanistically, CoSCs differentiated prematurely into transit-amplifying (TA) cells in Irf2{$\Delta$}IEC mice, which might explain their low CoSC counts. A similar phenotype was induced in wild-type mice by repeated injections of low doses of poly(I:C), which induces type I IFN. Collectively, we demonstrated that chronic IFN signaling physiologically stresses CoSCs. This study provides new insight into the development of colitis and molecular mechanisms that maintain functional CoSCs throughout life.},

Here, we present an integrated short- and long-read single-cell RNA-seq analysis of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. We demonstrate that over half of genes detected in standard short-read single-cell analyses are expressed as multiple, often functionally distinct, isoforms, including many transcription factors and key cytokine receptors. We observe global and HSC-specific changes in gene expression with ageing but limited impact of ageing on isoform usage. Integrating single-cell and cell-type-specific isoform landscape in haematopoiesis thus provides a new reference for comprehensive molecular profiling of heterogeneous tissues, as well as novel insights into transcriptional complexity, cell-type-specific splicing events and consequences of ageing.},

These induced FIPCs (iFIPCs) form spherical organoids that develop into adult-type budding organoids containing cells with intestinal stem cell properties. The resulting stem cells produce all intestinal epithelial cell lineages and undergo self-renewing cell divisions. After transplantation, the induced spherical and budding organoids can reconstitute colonic and intestinal epithelia, respectively. The same combination of four defined transcription factors can also induce human iFIPCs. This alternative approach for producing intestinal organoids may well facilitate application for disease analysis and therapy development.},

The mammalian intestinal epithelium is well suited to approach this problem, as it is composed of well-delineated units called crypts of Lieberk{\"u}hn. We found that Wnt5a, a noncanonical Wnt ligand, was required for crypt regeneration after injury in mice. Unlike controls, Wnt5a-deficient mice maintained an expanded population of proliferative epithelial cells in the wound. We used an in vitro system to enrich for intestinal epithelial stem cells to discover that Wnt5a inhibited proliferation of these cells. Surprisingly, the effects of Wnt5a were mediated by activation of transforming growth factor-{$\beta$} (TGF-{$\beta$}) signaling. These findings suggest a Wnt5a-dependent mechanism for forming new crypt units to reestablish homeostasis.},

This evidence has been explained by postulating a long period during which disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) survive in a foreign environment without developing into overt metastasis. Because of the asymptomatic nature of this phenomenon, isolation, and analysis of disseminated dormant cancer cells from clinically disease-free patients is ethically and technically highly problematic and currently these data are largely limited to the bone marrow. That said, detecting, profiling and treating indolent metastatic lesions before the onset of relapse is the imperative. To overcome this major limitation many laboratories developed in vitro models of the metastatic niche for different organs and different types of cancers. In this review we focus specifically on in vitro models designed to study metastatic dormancy of breast cancer cells (BCCs). We provide an overview of the BCCs employed in the different organotypic systems and address the components of the metastatic microenvironment that have been shown to impact on the dormant phenotype: tissue architecture, stromal cells, biochemical environment, oxygen levels, cell density. A brief description of the organ-specific in vitro models for bone, liver, and lung is provided. Finally, we discuss the strategies employed so far for the validation of the different systems.},

  abstract = {The survival rate in lung cancer remains stubbornly low and there is an urgent need for the identification of new therapeutic targets. In the last decade, several members of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes have been described altered in different tumor types. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms of their impact on cancer progression, as well as the application of this knowledge to cancer patient management are largely unknown. In this study, we performed targeted sequencing of a cohort of lung cancer patients on genes involved in chromatin structure. In addition, we studied at the protein level the expression of these genes in cancer samples and performed functional experiments to identify the molecular mechanisms linking alterations of chromatin remodeling genes and tumor development. Remarkably, we found that 20\% of lung cancer patients show ARID2 protein loss, partially explained by the presence of ARID2 mutations. In addition, we showed that ARID2 deficiency provokes profound chromatin structural changes altering cell transcriptional programs, which bolsters the proliferative and metastatic potential of the cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrated that ARID2 deficiency impairs DNA repair, enhancing the sensitivity of the cells to DNA-damaging agents. Our findings support that ARID2 is a bona fide tumor suppressor gene in lung cancer that may be exploited therapeutically.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION To obtain the best possible alignment between two sequences, it is necessary to include gaps in sequence alignments and use gap penalties. For aligning DNA sequences, a simple positive score for matches and a negative score for mismatches and gaps are most often used. To score matches and mismatches in alignments of proteins, it is necessary to know how often one amino acid is substituted for another in related proteins. In addition, a method is needed to account for insertions and deletions that sometimes appear in related DNA or protein sequences. To accommodate such sequence variations, gaps that appear in sequence alignments are given a negative penalty score reflecting the fact that they are not expected to occur very often. Mathematically speaking, it is very difficult to produce the best-possible alignment, either global or local, unless gaps are included in the alignment. This article discusses how to use gaps and gap penalties to optimize pairwise sequence alignments.},

  abstract = {Population dynamics can be inferred from genetic sequence data by using phylodynamic methods. These methods typically quantify the dynamics in unstructured populations or assume migration rates and effective population sizes to be constant through time in structured populations. When considering rates to vary through time in structured populations, the number of parameters to infer increases rapidly and the available data might not be sufficient to inform these. Additionally, it is often of interest to know what predicts these parameters rather than knowing the parameters themselves. Here, we introduce a method to ~infer the predictors for time-varying migration rates and effective population sizes by using a generalized linear model (GLM) approach under the marginal approximation of the structured coalescent. Using simulations, we show that our approach is able to reliably infer the model parameters and its predictors from phylogenetic trees. Furthermore, when simulating trees under the structured coalescent, we show that our new approach outperforms the discrete trait GLM model. We then apply our framework to a previously described Ebola virus dataset, where we infer the parameters and its predictors from genome sequences while accounting for phylogenetic uncertainty. We infer weekly cases to be the strongest predictor for effective population size and geographic distance the strongest predictor for migration. This approach is implemented as part of the BEAST2 package MASCOT, which allows us to jointly infer population dynamics, i.e. the parameters and predictors, within structured populations, the phylogenetic tree, and evolutionary parameters.},

We have investigated the role of Ets2 within intestinal epithelial cells in postnatal mouse colon development and tumorigenesis. Conditional inactivation of Ets2 within intestinal epithelial cells results in over representation of Ets2-deficient colon crypts within young and adult animals. This preferential representation is associated with an increased number of proliferative cells within the stem cell region and an increased rate of crypt fission in young mice that result in larger patches of Ets2-deficient crypts. These effects are consistent with a selective advantage of Ets2-deficient intestinal stem cells in colonizing colonic crypts and driving crypt fission. Ets2-deficient colon crypts have an increased mucosal thickness, an increased number of goblet cells, and an increased density. Mice with Ets2-deficient intestinal cells develop more colon tumors in response to treatment with azoxymethane and dextran sulfate sodium. The selective population of colon crypts, the altered differentiation state and increased sensitivity to carcinogen-induced tumors all indicate that Ets2 deficiency alters colon stem cell number or behavior. Ets2-dependent, epithelial cell-autonomous repression of intestinal tumors may contribute to protection from colon cancer of persons with increased dosage of chromosome 21.},

The magnitude of the risk was found to differ, even in population-based studies. Recent figures suggest that the risk of colon cancer for people with IBD increases by 0.5{\textendash}1.0\% yearly, 8{\textendash}10 years after diagnosis. The magnitude of CRC risk increases with early age at IBD diagnosis, longer duration of symptoms, and extent of the disease, with pancolitis having a more severe inflammation burden and risk of the dysplasia-carcinoma cascade. Considering the chronic nature of the disease, it is remarkable that there is such a low incidence of CRC in some of the population-based studies, and possible explanations have to be investigated. One possible cancer-protective factor could be treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid preparations (5-ASAs). Adenocarcinoma of the small bowel is extremely rare, compared with adenocarcinoma of the large bowel. Although only few small bowel cancers have been reported in Crohn's disease, the number was significantly increased in relation to the expected number.},

Different intestinal crypt populations dedifferentiate to provide new ISCs, but the transcriptional and signaling trajectories that guide this process are unclear, and a large body of work suggests that quiescent ``reserve'' ISCs contribute to regeneration. By timing the interval between LGR5+ lineage tracing and lethal injury, we show that ISC regeneration is explained nearly completely by dedifferentiation, with contributions from absorptive and secretory progenitors. The ISC-restricted transcription factor ASCL2 confers measurable competitive advantage to resting ISCs and is essential to restore the ISC compartment. Regenerating cells re-express Ascl2 days before Lgr5, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses reveal transcriptional paths underlying dedifferentiation. ASCL2 target genes include the interleukin-11 (IL-11) receptor Il11ra1, and recombinant IL-11 enhances crypt cell regenerative potential. These findings reveal cell dedifferentiation as the principal means for ISC restoration and highlight an ASCL2-regulated signal that enables this adaptive response.},

Here, we assessed another member of this small group of genes, Placenta Expressed Transcript 1 (Plet1), for its function in establishing trophoblast lineage identity and modulating trophoblast differentiation. We find that Plet1 is tightly repressed by DNA methylation in ESCs but expressed on the cell surface of TSCs and trophoblast giant cells. In hypomethylated ESCs that are prone to acquire some trophoblast characteristics, Plet1 is required to confer a trophoblast-specific gene expression pattern, including up-regulation of Elf5. Plet1 displays an unusual biphasic expression profile during TSC differentiation and thus may be pivotal in balancing trophoblast self-renewal and differentiation. Furthermore, overexpression and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout in TSCs showed that high Plet1 levels favour differentiation towards the trophoblast giant cell lineage, whereas lack of Plet1 preferentially induces syncytiotrophoblast formation. Thus, the endogenous dynamics of Plet1 expression establish important patterning cues within the trophoblast compartment by promoting differentiation towards the syncytiotrophoblast or giant cell pathway in Plet1-low and Plet1-high cells, respectively.},

  abstract = {Most biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) results from the activity of the molybdenum nitrogenase (Mo-nitrogenase, Nif), an oxygen-sensitive metalloenzyme complex found in all known diazotrophs. Two alternative forms of nitrogenase, the vanadium nitrogenase (V-nitrogenase, Vnf) and the iron-only nitrogenase (Fe-only nitrogenase, Anf) have also been identified in the genome of some organisms that encode for Nif. It has been suggested that alternative nitrogenases were responsible for N2-fixation on early Earth because oceans were depleted of bioavailable Mo. Results of recent phylogenetic- and structure-based studies suggest, however, that such an evolutionary path is unlikely, and favor a new model for a stepwise evolution of nitrogenase where the V-nitrogenase and the Fe-only nitrogenase are not the ancestor of the Mo-nitrogenase. Rather, Mo-nitrogenase emerged within the methanogenic archaea and then gave rise to the alternative forms suggesting they arose later in response to the availability of fixed N2 and local environmental factors that influenced metal availability. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on (1) the biochemistry of these complex systems highlighting the common and specific structural features and catalytic activities of the enzymes, (2) the recent progress in defining the discrete set of genes associated to N2-fixation and the regulatory features that coordinate the differential expression of genes in response to metal availability, and (3) the diverse taxonomic and phylogenic distribution of nitrogenase enzymes and the evolutionary history of BNF from the perspective of metal content and metal availability.},

This study investigated the effects of prolonged fasting-induced winter sleep on the fat and nitrogen metabolism of the species. Half of the animals were treated with continuous-release melatonin implants to induce artificial short photoperiod. Autumnal accumulation of fat was characterized by low plasma free fatty acid (FFA), diacylglycerol (DG), and triacylglycerol (TG) levels. After transition to winter catabolism, the circulating lipid levels increased due to enhanced lipolysis. Two months of fasting resulted in a steady 3.1 kg weight loss (28\% of body mass, 0.47\% day(-1)). Storage fat was mobilized during the winter sleep reflected by the elevated FFA and DG concentrations. The lowered insulin levels could be a stimulator for TG hydrolysis. The plasma total amino acid concentrations, urea levels, and urea-creatinine ratios decreased due to fasting, whereas ammonia and total protein concentrations remained stable. The effects of melatonin on energy metabolism were modest. The results indicate that the raccoon dog is well adapted to long-term wintertime fasting utilizing fat as the principal metabolic fuel. The species can maintain its protein catabolism constant for at least 60 days. Decreased cortisol and thyroid hormone concentrations may contribute to protein sparing.},

  abstract = {The raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) is an invasive canid originating from eastern Asia. Here, we review its physiological adaptations to wintering, with an emphasis on northern Europe, where the raccoon dog spends the coldest part of the year in winter sleep. The timing of physiological changes related to wintering is connected to photoperiod by melatonin. In preparation to winter, raccoon dogs display autumnal hyperphagia and fattening probably regulated by the interaction of several peptide hormones. Sufficient fat deposition is essential for survival through the cold season and for reproduction in spring. The wintering strategy includes alternating periods of physical activity and passivity. Effective arousal and foraging during warmer bouts are enabled by normoglycaemia. During active periods, raccoon dogs are opportunistic participants in the food web, and they mainly utilize ungulate carcasses, plant material, and small mammals. Preferred wintertime habitats include watersides, forests, wetlands, and gardens. However, many food items become limited in mid-winter and snow restricts foraging leading to a negative energy balance. During passivity, energy is preserved by denning and by modest metabolic suppression, probably enabled by decreased thyroid hormone levels. Sleepiness and satiety could be maintained by high growth hormone and leptin concentrations. Several hormones participate in the extension of phase II of fasting with selective fatty acid mobilization and efficient protein conservation. The blood count, organ function tests, bone mass, and bone biomechanical properties exhibit high resistance against catabolism, and breeding can be successful after significant weight loss.

  abstract = {Characterization of somatic mutations at single-cell resolution is essential to study cancer evolution, clonal mosaicism and cell plasticity. Here, we describe SComatic, an algorithm designed for the detection of somatic mutations in single-cell transcriptomic and ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequence) data sets directly without requiring matched bulk or single-cell DNA sequencing data. SComatic distinguishes somatic mutations from polymorphisms, RNA-editing events and artefacts using filters and statistical tests parameterized on non-neoplastic samples. Using {$>$}2.6\,million single cells from 688 single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) data sets spanning cancer and non-neoplastic samples, we show that SComatic detects mutations in single cells accurately, even in differentiated cells from polyclonal tissues that are not amenable to mutation detection using existing methods. Validated against matched genome sequencing and scRNA-seq data, SComatic achieves F1 scores between 0.6 and 0.7 across diverse data sets, in comparison to 0.2{\textendash}0.4 for the second-best performing method. In summary, SComatic permits de novo mutational signature analysis, and the study of clonal heterogeneity and mutational burdens at single-cell resolution.},

These drugs have been used for millennia in both spiritual and medicinal contexts, and a number of recent clinical successes have spurred a renewed interest in developing psychedelic therapies3{\textendash}9. Nevertheless, a unifying mechanism that can account for these shared phenomenological and therapeutic properties remains unknown. Here we demonstrate in mice that the ability to reopen the social reward learning critical period is a shared property across psychedelic drugs. Notably, the time course of critical period reopening is proportional to the duration of acute subjective effects reported in humans. Furthermore, the ability to reinstate social reward learning in adulthood is paralleled by metaplastic restoration of oxytocin-mediated long-term depression in the nucleus accumbens. Finally, identification of differentially expressed genes in the `open state' versus the `closed state' provides evidence that reorganization of the extracellular matrix is a common downstream mechanism underlying psychedelic drug-mediated critical period reopening. Together these results have important implications for the implementation of psychedelics in clinical practice, as well as the design of novel compounds for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disease.},

Previous scientific knowledge in cell biology is largely limited to data generated by bulk profiling methods, which only provide averaged read-outs that generally mask cellular heterogeneity. This averaged approach is particularly problematic when the biological effect of interest is limited to only a subpopulation of cells such as stem/progenitor cells within a given tissue, or immune cell subsets infiltrating a tumor. Great advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) enabled scientists to overcome this limitation and allow for in depth interrogation of previously unexplored rare cell types. Due to the high sensitivity of scRNAseq, adequate attention must be put into experimental setup and execution. Careful handling and processing of cells for scRNAseq is critical to preserve the native expression profile that will ensure meaningful analysis and conclusions. Here, we delineate the individual steps of a typical single-cell analysis workflow from tissue procurement, cell preparation, to platform selection and data analysis, and we discuss critical challenges in each of these steps, which will serve as a helpful guide to navigate the complex field of single-cell sequencing.},

The effect of single drug therapy, however, is often only short-lived as the virus readily develops drug-resistant mutants. In this paper we provide analytic approximations for the rate of emergence of resistant virus. We study the decline of wildtype virus and the rise of resistant mutant virus in different compartments of the virus population such as free plasma virus, cells infected with actively replicating virus long-lived infected cells and cells carrying defective provirus. The model results are compared with data on the rise of drug-resistant virus in three HIV-1 infected patients treated with neverapine (NVP). We find that the half life of latently infected cells is between 10 and 20 days, whereas the half-life of cells with defective provirus is about 80 days. We also provide a crude estimate for the basic reproductive ratio of HIV-1 during NVP therapy.},

Findings were validated by analysis of an independent replication cohort [99 CD, 100 UC, 95 controls]. In the discovery cohort, we also defined baseline expression correlates of future treatment escalation using cross-validated elastic-net and random forest modelling, along with a pragmatic ratio detection procedure.Disease-specific transcriptomes were defined in IBD [8697 transcripts], CD [7152], and UC [8521], with the most highly significant changes in single genes, including CD177 (log2-fold change [LFC] = 4.63, p = 4.05 {\texttimes} 10-118), MCEMP1 [LFC = 2.45, p = 7.37 {\texttimes} 10-109], and S100A12 [LFC = 2.31, p = 2.15 {\texttimes} 10-93]. Significantly over-represented pathways included IL-1 [p = 1.58 {\texttimes} 10-11], IL-4, and IL-13 [p = 8.96 {\texttimes} 10-9]. Highly concordant results were obtained using multiple regulatory activity inference tools applied to the discovery and replication cohorts. These analyses demonstrated central roles in IBD for the transcription factors NFE2, SPI1 [PU.1], CEBPB, and IRF2, all regulators of cytokine signalling, based on a consistent signal across cohorts and transcription factor ranking methods. A number of simple transcriptome-based models were associated with the need for treatment escalation, including the binary CLEC5A/CDH2 expression ratio in UC (hazard ratio = 23.4, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 5.3{\textendash}102.0).Transcriptomic analysis has allowed for a detailed characterisation of IBD pathobiology, with important potential translational implications.},

  abstract = {Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and gene loss are key processes in bacterial evolution. However, the role of gene gain and loss in the emergence and maintenance of ecologically differentiated bacterial populations remains an open question. Here, we use whole-genome sequence data to quantify gene gain and loss for 27 lineages of the plant-associated bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. We apply an extensive error-control procedure that accounts for errors in draft genome data and greatly improves the accuracy of patterns of gene occurrence among these genomes. We demonstrate a history of extensive genome fluctuation for this species and show that individual lineages could have acquired thousands of genes in the same period in which a 1\% amino acid divergence accrues in the core genome. Elucidating the dynamics of genome fluctuation reveals the rapid turnover of gained genes, such that the majority of recently gained genes are quickly lost. Despite high observed rates of fluctuation, a phylogeny inferred from patterns of gene occurrence is similar to a phylogeny based on amino acid replacements within the core genome. Furthermore, the core genome phylogeny suggests that P. syringae should be considered a number of distinct species, with levels of divergence at least equivalent to those between recognized bacterial species. Gained genes are transferred from a variety of sources, reflecting the depth and diversity of the potential gene pool available via HGT. Overall, our results provide further insights into the evolutionary dynamics of genome fluctuation and implicate HGT as a major factor contributing to the diversification of P. syringae lineages.},

Through required coursework, doctoral students are indoctrinated into basic guidelines and frameworks that provide a common foundation for scholars to interact with one another. Lacking such forums in many of our doctoral granting institutions (Stout 2013), the field of public management continues to struggle with an ambivalence toward qualitative approaches. Lack of shared understanding concerning basic tenets of qualitative methodology abounds. This article is intended for qualitative consumers, those not formally trained in qualitative methods but who serve as peer reviewers, content experts, and advisors in arenas where qualitative methods are encountered. Adopting a postpositivistic stance dominant in the field, we seek to offer a pragmatic perspective on qualitative methods with regards to some basic tenets of rigor appropriate (and inappropriate) for assessing the contribution of qualitative research. We argue that the first step in this effort is to stop conflating data type (qualitative versus quantitative) with inductive versus deductive modes of inquiry. Using deductive modes as the basis for comparison, we discuss both common, as well as, diverging criteria of quality and rigor for inductive modes of inquiry. We conclude with a discussion of rigor in emerging methods which utilize qualitative data but from within a deductive, mixed, or hybrid mode of inquiry.},

The aim of this study was to compare colorectal cancer frequency among kindreds of patients who had ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer with that of control patients who had ulcerative colitis but no cancer. METHODS: Questionnaires were mailed to subjects to assess cancer occurrence among relatives. Eligible cases included 174 ulcerative colitis patients with colorectal cancer seen at Mayo Clinic in 1976-1994; 174 contemporaneous ulcerative colitis controls without cancer were matched on birth year, sex, and extent and duration of colitis. RESULTS: The responding 147 case and 150 control subjects reported on 1044 and 1090 first-degree relatives, respectively. Colorectal cancer occurred in 14.3\% case kindreds and 6.7\% control kindreds (P = 0.03). By logistic regression, a family history of sporadic colorectal cancer was an independent risk factor for cancer in ulcerative colitis (odds ratio, 2.33; 95\% confidence interval, 1.06-5.14; P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: A familial association exists between colorectal cancers occurring with ulcerative colitis and those in the general population. Colorectal cancer in persons with ulcerative colitis represents a risk factor for colorectal cancer in their noncolitic relatives. Likewise, a family history of sporadic colorectal cancer increases the risk of colorectal cancer with ulcerative colitis.},

Whereas dynamics of epithelial stem cells during homeostasis are increasingly well understood, how stem cells are redirected from a tissue-maintenance program to initiate repair after injury remains unclear. Here we examined infection by Heligmosomoides polygyrus, a co-evolved pathosymbiont of mice, to assess the epithelial response to disruption of the mucosal barrier. H. polygyrus disrupts tissue integrity by penetrating the duodenal mucosa, where it develops while surrounded by a multicellular granulomatous infiltrate2. Crypts overlying larvae-associated granulomas did not express intestinal stem cell markers, including Lgr53, in spite of continued epithelial proliferation. Granuloma-associated Lgr5- crypt epithelium activated an interferon-gamma (IFN-{$\gamma$})-dependent transcriptional program, highlighted by Sca-1 expression, and IFN-{$\gamma$}-producing immune cells were found in granulomas. A similar epithelial response accompanied systemic activation of immune cells, intestinal irradiation, or ablation of Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells. When cultured in vitro, granuloma-associated crypt cells formed spheroids similar to those formed by fetal epithelium, and a sub-population of H. polygyrus-induced cells activated a fetal-like transcriptional program, demonstrating that adult intestinal tissues can repurpose aspects of fetal development. Therefore, re-initiation of the developmental program represents a fundamental mechanism by which the intestinal crypt can remodel itself to sustain function after injury.},

In slow-turnover tissues, long-lived differentiated cells can re-enter the cell cycle or transdifferentiate to another cell type to promote repair. Here, we show that in a high-turnover tissue, severe damage to the differentiated compartment induces progenitors to transiently acquire a unique transcriptional and morphological postmitotic state. We highlight this in an acute villus injury model in the mouse intestine, where we identified a population of progenitor-derived cells that covered injured villi. These atrophy-induced villus epithelial cells (aVECs) were enriched for fetal markers but were differentiated and lineage committed. We further established a role for aVECs in maintaining barrier integrity through the activation of yes-associated protein (YAP). Notably, loss of YAP activity led to impaired villus regeneration. Thus, we define a key repair mechanism involving the activation of a fetal-like program during injury-induced differentiation, a process we term "adaptive differentiation."},

A specific environment, namely the ISC niche constituted by the surrounding mesenchymal stem cells, the factors they secrete and the extracellular matrix (ECM), tightly controls ISC homeostasis. Colon ECM exerts physical constraint on the enclosed stem cells through peculiar topography, stiffness and deformability.

  abstract = {Motivation Quality control (QC) is a critical step in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis. Low-quality cells are removed from the analysis during the QC process to avoid misinterpretation of the data. An important QC metric is the mitochondrial proportion (mtDNA\%), which is used as a threshold to filter out low-quality cells. Early publications in the field established a threshold of 5\% and since then, it has been used as a default in several software packages for scRNA-seq data analysis, and adopted as a standard in many scRNA-seq studies. However, the validity of using a uniform threshold across different species, single-cell technologies, tissues and cell types has not been adequately assessed. Results We systematically analyzed 5~530~106 cells reported in 1349 annotated datasets available in the PanglaoDB database and found that the average mtDNA\% in scRNA-seq data across human tissues is significantly higher than in mouse tissues. This difference is not confounded by the platform used to generate the data. Based on this finding, we propose new reference values of the mtDNA\% for 121 tissues of mouse and 44 tissues of humans. In general, for mouse tissues, the 5\% threshold performs well to distinguish between healthy and low-quality cells. However, for human tissues, the 5\% threshold should be reconsidered as it fails to accurately discriminate between healthy and low-quality cells in 29.5\% (13 of 44) tissues analyzed. We conclude that omitting the mtDNA\% QC filter or adopting a suboptimal mtDNA\% threshold may lead to erroneous biological interpretations of scRNA-seq data.

  abstract = {Biologists frequently attempt to infer the character states at ancestral nodes of a phylogeny from the distribution of traits observed in contemporary organisms. Because phylogenies are normally inferences from data, it is desirable to account for the uncertainty in estimates of the tree and its branch lengths when making inferences about ancestral states or other comparative parameters. Here we present a general Bayesian approach for testing comparative hypotheses across statistically justified samples of phylogenies, focusing on the specific issue of reconstructing ancestral states. The method uses Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques for sampling phylogenetic trees and for investigating the parameters of a statistical model of trait evolution. We describe how to combine information about the uncertainty of the phylogeny with uncertainty in the estimate of the ancestral state. Our approach does not constrain the sample of trees only to those that contain the ancestral node or nodes of interest, and we show how to reconstruct ancestral states of uncertain nodes using a most-recent-common-ancestor approach. We illustrate the methods with data on ribonuclease evolution in the Artiodactyla. Software implementing the methods (BayesMultiState) is available from the authors.},

Differentiated mammary gland, neuronal, and pancreatic exocrine cells, identified using a combination of cell sorting and lineage tracing approaches, efficiently convert to proliferating cells with properties of stem/progenitor cells of their respective tissues after YAP induction. YAP-induced mammary stem/progenitor cells show molecular and functional properties similar to endogenous MaSCs, including organoid formation and mammary gland reconstitution after transplantation. Because YAP/TAZ function is also important for self-renewal of endogenous stem cells in culture, our findings have implications for understanding the molecular determinants of the somatic stem cell state.},

Using multiple analyses, a four-pyroptosis-gene signature was constructed, and all LUAD patients were categorized as low-risk or high-risk with a longer overall survival (OS) time in the low-risk group(P~{$<~$}0.001). This signature had power prognosis and stratification which was validated by six independent datasets and clinical subtypes. Besides, this signature showed distinct clinical outcomes, immune landscapes in different risk groups. Moreover, the low-risk group had a higher response against immunotherapy with a lower TIDE score. Importantly, this signature surpassed other biomarkers (TIDE, TMB, PD-L1) in predicting prognosis. Overall, the current study might help with precise prognostic prediction and crucial treatment strategies, eventually promoting tailored therapy for LUAD patients.},

Nitrogen fixation is a prevalent phenomenon exhibited by many organisms to fix the environmental nitrogen source in a usable form. Free-living N2-fixing cyanobacteria and Azolla (a symbiotic combination of water fern Azolla, Nostoc and Anabaena) are widely used as organic fertilizer for rice as well as corn, soybean, groundnuts. Under nitrogen limitation, a portion of the cyanobacteria can recognize a particular cell called heterocyst that offers an ideal microoxic climate for the legitimate working of oxygen-sensitive enzyme nitrogenase. Nitrogenase complex is engaged in N2 fixation in heterocystous cyanobacteria which is also followed by hydrogen manufacturing. A cyanobacteria possesses nif genes among multiple such species, which can be organized by polymerase chain reaction at the molecular level. Nitrogen control in cyanobacteria is mediated by Ntc A, a transcriptional regulator that belongs to the activator of the catabolite factor and is therefore distinct from a well-characterized Ntr scheme. This study is an attempt to recruit useful knowledge about the characteristics of cyanobacteria and their possible role in addressing the future wellbeing of the planet's agricultural and environmental challenges.},

Since the Green Revolution, massive amounts of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers have been produced from atmospheric nitrogen and natural gas, threatening the sustainability of global food production and degrading the environment. There is a need for alternative means of bringing nitrogen to crops, and taking greater advantage of biological nitrogen fixation seems a logical option. Legumes are used in most cropping systems around the world because of the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with rhizobia. However, the world's three major cereal crops{\textemdash}rice, wheat, and maize{\textemdash}do not associate with rhizobia. In this review, we will survey how genetic approaches in rhizobia and their legume hosts allowed tremendous progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling root nodule symbioses, and how this knowledge paves the way for engineering such associations in non-legume crops. We will also discuss challenges in bringing these systems into the field and how they can be surmounted by interdisciplinary collaborations between synthetic biologists, microbiologists, plant biologists, breeders, agronomists, and policymakers.},

Here, we analyze sequences from 232 patients sampled over 7 months in Sierra Leone, along with 86 previously released genomes from earlier in the epidemic. We confirm sustained human-to-human transmission within Sierra Leone and find no evidence for import or export of EBOV across national borders after its initial introduction. Using high-depth replicate sequencing, we observe both host-to-host transmission and recurrent emergence of intrahost genetic variants. We trace the increasing impact of purifying selection in suppressing the accumulation of nonsynonymous mutations over time. Finally, we note changes in the mucin-like domain of EBOV glycoprotein that merit further investigation. These findings clarify the movement of EBOV within the region and describe viral evolution during prolonged human-to-human transmission.},

Reprogramming of the intestinal epithelium towards a protective effector state is important to manage inflammation and immunity and can be therapeutically targeted. The role of epigenetic regulatory enzymes within these processes is not yet defined. Here, we use a mouse model that has an intestinal-epithelial specific deletion of the histone demethylase Lsd1 (cKO mice), which maintains the epithelium in a fixed reparative state. Challenge of cKO mice with bacteria-induced colitis or a helminth infection model both resulted in increased pathogenesis. Mechanistically, we discovered that LSD1 is important for goblet cell maturation and goblet-cell effector molecules such as RELM{\ss}. We propose that this may be in part mediated by directly controlling genes that facilitate cytoskeletal organization, which is important in goblet cell biology. This study therefore identifies intestinal-epithelial epigenetic regulation by LSD1 as a critical element in host protection from infection.},

Setting The IQVIA Medical Research data (IMRD) primary care database. Participants All individuals registered with general practices contributing to IMRD during the period 01 January 2000{\textendash}31 December 2018. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was the recorded diagnosis of IBD. Results 11 325 025 individuals were included and 65 700 IBD cases were identified, of which 22 560 were incident diagnoses made during the study period. Overall, there were 8077 incident cases of Crohn's disease (CD) and 12 369 incident cases of ulcerative colitis (UC). Crude incidence estimates of `IBD overall', CD and UC were 28.6 (28.2 to 28.9), 10.2 (10.0 to 10.5) and 15.7 (15.4 to 15.9)/100 000 person years, respectively. No change in IBD incidence was observed for adults aged 17{\textendash}40 years and children aged 0{\textendash}9 years. However, for adults aged over 40 years, incidence fell from 37.8 (34.5 to 41.4) to 23.6 (21.3 to 26.0)/100 000 person years (average decrease 2.3\% (1.9 to 2.7)/year (p{$<$}0.0001)). In adolescents aged 10{\textendash}16 years, incidence rose from 13.1 (8.4 to 19.5) to 25.4 (19.5 to 32.4)/100 000 person years (average increase 3.0\% (1.7 to 4.3)/year (p{$<$}0.0001)). Point prevalence estimates on 31 December 2018 for IBD overall, CD and UC were 725, 276 and 397 per 100 000 people, respectively. Conclusions This is one of the largest studies ever undertaken to investigate trends in IBD epidemiology. Although we observed stable or falling incidence of IBD in adults, our results are consistent with some of the highest reported global incidence and prevalence rates for IBD, with a 94\% rise in incidence in adolescents. Further investigation is required to understand the aetiological drivers.},

However, biologically plausible mechanisms that allow these distinct functional capabilities to coexist in the same neuron are poorly defined. Low-threshold, inactivating (A-type) K(+) currents (I(A)) are found in many biological neurons and are historically known for enabling low-frequency firing. By performing simulations using a conductance-based model neuron, here we show that biologically plausible shifts in I(A) conductance and inactivation kinetics produce dissociated effects on gain and intrinsic firing. This enables I(A) to regulate gain without major changes in intrinsic firing rate. Tuning I(A) properties may thus represent a previously unsuspected single-current mechanism of silent gain control in neurons.},

The field measurements of nitrogen fixation activity were conducted in situ for two different types of soil crusts dominated by Stigonema (V1 type) and Nostoc with Scytonema (V2 type). The nitrogen fixation process had similar dynamics in both crusts but nitrogen fixation rates were different. The crusts of the V2 type showed a significantly higher acetylene reduction activity, with ethylene production rate of 1.76 {$\pm$} 0.49 g C2H4 m-2 h-1 at 15{\textdegree}C, compared with V1-type soil crusts, with a rate of 0.53 {$\pm$} 0.21 mg C2H4 m-2 h-1 at 15{\textdegree}C. The daily value of acetylene reduction activity in V2-type soil crusts was 32.7 {$\pm$} 6.2 mg C2H4 m-2 d-1 and in V1-type crusts, 12.3 {$\pm$} 1.8 mg C2H4 m-2 d-1. After recalculation for N, the daily values of nitrogen fixation were in the range 3.3{\textendash}22.3 mg N m-2 d-1, which is a few times higher than the values of N input from the precipitation to the soil in the studied regions. The dependence of nitrogen-fixation activity on temperature and light intensity of biological soil crusts was investigated. On the basis of temperature models obtained from the dependence, the nitrogen balance was calculated for the growing season (approximately 120 days). The crusts dominated by Stigonema species were fixing 0.3 g N m-2 (ethylene production rate, 1.10 g C2H4 m-2) and crusts dominated by Nostoc and Scytonema were fixing 1.3 g N m-2 (4.10 g C2H4 m-2).},

We describe multiple progenitor subgroups, showing unexpected transcriptional priming toward seven differentiation fates but no progenitors with a mixed state. Transcriptional differentiation is correlated with combinations of known and previously undefined transcription factors, suggesting that the process is tightly regulated. Histone maps and knockout assays are consistent with early transcriptional priming, while traditional transplantation experiments suggest that in~vivo priming may still allow for plasticity given strong perturbations.

Mechanistic insights for this study were derived from native human colonic crypts and cryptlike organoids expressing MUC2-mNEON. Importantly, we demonstrate that the human colonic stem cell niche is also a cholinergic niche, and that activation of muscarinic receptors initiates calcium signals at the apical pole of intestinal stem cells and neighbouring crypt-basegoblet-cells. The calcium signal `trigger zone' is defined by a microdomain of juxtaposed calcium stores expressing TPC1 and InsP3R3 calcium channels. Co-activation of TPC1 and InsP3R3 is required for generation of cholinergic calcium signals and downstream secretion of hydrated mucus, which culminates in the flushing of the colonic stem cell niche.},

However, the dextran sulphate sodium (DSS-) induced colitis model has some advantages when compared to other animal models of colitis. It is well appreciated and widely used model of inflammatory bowel disease because of its simplicity. It has many similarities to human IBD, which are mentioned in the paper. In spite of its simplicity and wide applicability, there are also traps that need to be taken into account when using DSS model. As demonstrated in the present paper, various factors may affect susceptibility to DSS-induced lesions and modify results.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen fixation is a widespread metabolic trait in certain types of microorganisms called diazotrophs. Bioavailable nitrogen is limited in various habitats on land and in the sea, and accordingly, a range of plant, animal, and single-celled eukaryotes have evolved symbioses with diverse diazotrophic bacteria, with enormous economic and ecological benefits. Until recently, all known nitrogen-fixing symbionts were heterotrophs such as nodulating rhizobia, or photoautotrophs such as cyanobacteria. In 2016, the first chemoautotrophic nitrogen-fixing symbionts were discovered in a common family of marine clams, the Lucinidae. Chemosynthetic nitrogen-fixing symbionts use the chemical energy stored in reduced sulfur compounds to power carbon and nitrogen fixation, making them metabolic 'all-rounders' with multiple functions in the symbiosis. This distinguishes them from heterotrophic symbionts that require a source of carbon from their host, and their chemosynthetic metabolism distinguishes them from photoautotrophic symbionts that produce oxygen, a potent inhibitor of nitrogenase. In this review, we consider evolutionary aspects of this discovery, by comparing strategies that have evolved for hosting intracellular nitrogen-fixing symbionts in plants and animals. The symbiosis between lucinid clams and chemosynthetic nitrogen-fixing bacteria also has important ecological impacts, as they form a nested symbiosis with endangered marine seagrasses. Notably, nitrogen fixation by lucinid symbionts may help support seagrass health by providing a source of nitrogen in seagrass habitats. These discoveries were enabled by new techniques for understanding the activity of microbial populations in natural environments. However, an animal (or plant) host represents a diverse landscape of microbial niches due to its structural, chemical, immune and behavioural properties. In future, methods that resolve microbial activity at the single cell level will provide radical new insights into the regulation of nitrogen fixation in chemosynthetic symbionts, shedding new light on the evolution of nitrogen-fixing symbioses in contrasting hosts and environments.},

In addition, we observed very persistent pre-phasing effects although the base calling software corrects for these. Removal of shortened sequences abolished these effects and allowed analysis of the actual mutations. The average error rate determined was 0.24\,{$\pm$}\,0.06\% per base and the percentage of mutated sequences was found to be 6.4\,{$\pm$}\,1.24\%. Constant regions at the 5{$\prime$}- and 3{$\prime$}-end, e.g., primer binding sites used in in vitro selection procedures seem to have no effect on mutation rates and re-sequencing of samples obtains very reproducible results.

In this project, we compare estimation methods using next-generation sequencing (k-mer methods and average read depth of single-copy genes) to measurements from flow cytometry, a standard method for genome size measures, using ground beetles (Carabidae) and other members of the beetle suborder Adephaga as our test system.

Additionally, we report flow cytometry measurements for five previously unmeasured carabid species, as well as 21 new draft genomes and six new draft transcriptomes across eight species of adephagan beetles. No single sequence-based method performed well on all species, and all tended to underestimate the genome sizes, although only slightly in most samples.

However, the tumor cell-intrinsic role of Nrp2 in cancer progression is incompletely understood. To address this question, we employed CRISPR-Cas9 technology to generate Nrp2-knockout organoids derived from murine CRC tumors with a mesenchymal phenotype. Transcriptome profiling and tumor tissue analysis showed that Nrp2 loss resulted in mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), which was accompanied with restored polarity and tight junction stabilization. Signaling pathway analysis revealed that Nrp2-knockout organoids acquire de novo dependency on insulin receptor (IR) signaling and autophagy as alternative survival mechanisms. Combined inhibition of IR signaling and autophagy prevented the stabilization of cell-cell junctions, reduced metabolic activity, and caused profound cell death in Nrp2-knockout organoids.

The differentiation of each of these subsets is governed, in large part, by environmental cytokine signals and the subsequent activation of downstream, cell-intrinsic transcription factor networks. Ikaros zinc finger (IkZF) transcription factors are known regulators of immune cell development, including that of CD4+ T cell subsets. Over the past decade, members of the IkZF family have also been implicated in the differentiation and function of individual T helper cell subsets, including T helper 1 (TH1), TH2, TH17, T follicular (TFH), and T regulatory (TREG) cells. Now, an increasing body of literature suggests that the distinct cell-specific cytokine environments responsible for the development of each subset result in differential expression of IkZF factors across T helper populations. Intriguingly, recent studies suggest that IkZF members influence T helper subset differentiation in a feed-forward fashion through the regulation of these same cytokine-signaling pathways. Here, we review the increasingly prominent role for IkZF transcription factors in the differentiation of effector CD4+ T helper cell subsets.},

However, several cyanobacterial strains have over the years been isolated and cultured from Azolla from all over the world. The genomes of 10 of these strains were sequenced and compared with each other, with other symbiotic cyanobacterial strains, and with similar strains that were not isolated from a symbiotic association. The 10 strains fell into three distinct groups: six strains were nearly identical to the non-symbiotic strain, Nostoc (Anabaena) variabilis ATCC 29413; three were similar to the symbiotic strain, Nostoc punctiforme, and one, Nostoc sp. 2RC, was most similar to non-symbiotic strains of Nostoc linckia. However, Nostoc sp. 2RC was unusual because it has three sets of nitrogenase genes; it has complete gene clusters for two distinct Mo-nitrogenases and an alternative V-nitrogenase. Genes for Mo-nitrogenase, sugar transport, chemotaxis and pili characterized all the symbiotic strains. Several of the strains infected the liverwort Blasia, including N. variabilis ATCC 29413, which did not originate from Azolla but rather from a sewage pond. However, only Nostoc sp. 2RC, which produced highly motile hormogonia, was capable of high-frequency infection of Blasia. Thus, some of these strains, which grow readily in the laboratory, may be useful in establishing novel symbiotic associations with other plants.},

The nifH1 gene, which encodes the dinitrogenase reductase of the Mo nitrogenase that is expressed only in heterocysts, is cotranscribed with nifD1 and nifK1, which together encode the Mo dinitrogenase. These genes were expressed in the presence or absence of molybdate or vanadate. The vnfH gene, which encodes the dinitrogenase reductase of the V nitrogenase, was located about 23 kb from vnfDGK, which encodes the V dinitrogenase; however, like vnfDGK, vnfH was expressed only in the absence of molybdate, with or without vanadate. Like nifH1, the vnfH gene was expressed exclusively in heterocysts under either aerobic or anaerobic growth conditions and thus is under the control of developmental factors. The vnfH mutant was able to grow diazotrophically using the V nitrogenase, because NifH1, which was also made in cells starved for molybdate, could substitute for VnfH. Under oxic conditions, the nifH1 mutant grew in the absence of molybdate but not in its presence, using VnfH, while the nifH1 vnfH double mutant did not grow diazotrophically with or without molybdate or vanadate. A nifH1 mutant that expressed nifDK and vnfH but not vnfDGK was able to grow and fix nitrogen normally, indicating that VnfH could substitute for NifH in the Mo nitrogenase and that these dinitrogenase reductases are not involved in determining the metal specificity of the Mo nitrogenase or the V nitrogenase.},

Following disruption of the intestinal epithelium, wound-associated epithelial (WAE) cells form the initial barrier over the wound. Our goal was to determine the critical factor that promotes WAE cell differentiation. Using an adaptation of our in~vitro primary epithelial cell culture system, we found that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) signaling through one of its receptors, Ptger4, was sufficient to drive a differentiation state morphologically and transcriptionally similar to in~vivo WAE cells. WAE cell differentiation was a permanent state and dominant over enterocyte differentiation in plasticity experiments. WAE cell differentiation was triggered by nuclear ?-catenin signaling independent of canonical Wnt signaling. Creation of WAE cells via the PGE2-Ptger4 pathway was required in~vivo, as mice with loss of Ptger4 in the intestinal epithelium did not produce WAE cells and exhibited impaired wound repair. Our results demonstrate a mechanism by which WAE cells are formed by PGE2 and suggest a process of adaptive cellular reprogramming of the intestinal epithelium that occurs to ensure proper repair to injury.},

  abstract = {The Ebola virus disease epidemic in West Africa is the largest on record, responsible for over 28,599 cases and more than 11,299 deaths. Genome sequencing in viral outbreaks is desirable to characterize the infectious agent and determine its evolutionary rate. Genome sequencing also allows the identification of signatures of host adaptation, identification and monitoring of diagnostic targets, and characterization of responses to vaccines and treatments. The Ebola virus (EBOV) genome substitution rate in the Makona strain has been estimated at between 0.87\,{\texttimes}\,10(-3) and 1.42\,{\texttimes}\,10(-3) mutations per site per year. This is equivalent to 16-27 mutations in each genome, meaning that sequences diverge rapidly enough to identify distinct sub-lineages during a prolonged epidemic. Genome sequencing provides a high-resolution view of pathogen evolution and is increasingly sought after for outbreak surveillance. Sequence data may be used to guide control measures, but only if the results are generated quickly enough to inform interventions. Genomic surveillance during the epidemic has been sporadic owing to a lack of local sequencing capacity coupled with practical difficulties transporting samples to remote sequencing facilities. To address this problem, here we devise a genomic surveillance system that utilizes a novel nanopore DNA sequencing instrument. In April 2015 this system was transported in standard airline luggage to Guinea and used for real-time genomic surveillance of the ongoing epidemic. We present sequence data and analysis of 142 EBOV samples collected during the period March to October 2015. We were able to generate results less than 24 h after receiving an Ebola-positive sample, with the sequencing process taking as little as 15-60 min. We show that real-time genomic surveillance is possible in resource-limited settings and can be established rapidly to monitor outbreaks.},

In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, other than the reference accession Col-0, all other accessions de novo assembled with long-reads until now have used PacBio continuous long reads (CLR). Although these assemblies sometimes achieved chromosome-arm level contigs, they inevitably broke near the centromeres, excluding megabases of DNA from analysis in pan-genome projects. Since PacBio high-fidelity (HiFi) reads circumvent the high error rate of CLR technologies, albeit at the expense of read length, we compared a CLR assembly of accession Ey15-2 to HiFi assemblies of the same sample performed by five different assemblers starting from subsampled data sets, allowing us to evaluate the impact of coverage and read length. We found that centromeres and rDNA clusters are responsible for 71\% of contig breaks in the CLR scaffolds, while relatively short stretches of GA/TC repeats are at the core of {$>$}85\% of the unfilled gaps in our best HiFi assemblies. Since the HiFi technology consistently enabled us to reconstruct gapless centromeres and 5S rDNA clusters, we demonstrate the value of the approach by comparing these previously inaccessible regions of the genome between two A. thaliana accessions.},

Here we introduce the cross-platform software tool, TempEst (formerly known as Path-O-Gen), for the visualization and analysis of temporally sampled sequence data. Given a molecular phylogeny and the dates of sampling for each sequence, TempEst uses an interactive regression approach to explore the association between genetic divergence through time and sampling dates. TempEst can be used to (1) assess whether there is sufficient temporal signal in the data to proceed with phylogenetic molecular clock analysis, and (2) identify sequences whose genetic divergence and sampling date are incongruent. Examination of the latter can help identify data quality problems, including errors in data annotation, sample contamination, sequence recombination, or alignment error. We recommend that all users of the molecular clock models implemented in BEAST first check their data using TempEst prior to analysis.},

  abstract = {Horizontal or Lateral Gene Transfer (HGT or LGT) is the transmission of portions of genomic DNA between organisms through a process decoupled from vertical inheritance. In the presence of HGT events, different fragments of the genome are the result of different evolutionary histories. This can therefore complicate the investigations of evolutionary relatedness of lineages and species. Also, as HGT can bring into genomes radically different genotypes from distant lineages, or even new genes bearing new functions, it is a major source of phenotypic innovation and a mechanism of niche adaptation. For example, of particular relevance to human health is the lateral transfer of antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity determinants, leading to the emergence of pathogenic lineages []. Computational identification of HGT events relies upon the investigation of sequence composition or evolutionary history of genes. Sequence composition-based ("parametric") methods search for deviations from the genomic average, whereas evolutionary history-based ("phylogenetic") approaches identify genes whose evolutionary history significantly differs from that of the host species. The evaluation and benchmarking of HGT inference methods typically rely upon simulated genomes, for which the true history is known. On real data, different methods tend to infer different HGT events, and as a result it can be difficult to ascertain all but simple and clear-cut HGT events.},

  abstract = {The intestinal epithelium is replenished every 3{\textendash}4 days through an orderly process that maintains important secretory and absorptive functions while preserving a continuous mucosal barrier. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) derive from a stable population of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that reside in the basal crypts. When intestinal injury reaches the crypts and damages IECs, a mechanism to replace them is needed. Recent research has highlighted the existence of distinct populations of acute and chronic damage-associated ISCs and their roles in maintaining homeostasis in several intestinal perturbation models. What remains unknown is how the damage-associated regenerative ISC population functions in the setting of chronic inflammation, as opposed to acute injury. What long-term consequences result from persistent inflammation and other cellular insults to the ISC niche? What particular ``regenerative'' cell types provide the most efficacious restorative properties? Which differentiated IECs maintain the ability to de-differentiate and restore the ISC niche? This review will cover the latest research on damage-associated regenerative ISCs and epigenetic factors that determine ISC fate, as well as provide opinions on future studies that need to be undertaken to understand the repercussions of the emergence of these cells, their contribution to relapses in inflammatory bowel disease, and their potential use in therapeutics for chronic intestinal diseases.},

We developed a chronic-injury model in human colonoid monolayers by repeated rounds of air-liquid interface and submerged culture. We use this model to understand how chronic intestinal damage affects the ability of IECs to (1) respond to microbial stimulation, using the Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) agonist FliC and (2) regenerate and protect the epithelium from further damage. Repeated rounds of damage impair the ability of IECs to regrow and respond to TLR stimulation. We also identify mRNA expression and DNA methylation changes in genes associated with IBD and colon cancer. This methodology results in a human model of recurrent IEC injury like that which occurs in IBD.},

  abstract = {Background \& Aims: Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) is a ubiquitous zinc finger tumor suppressor that is often mutated in prostate cancer. Our aims were to establish the frequency of KLF6 inactivation in sporadic and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated colorectal cancers (CRC); to correlate these abnormalities with mutation and/or loss of TP53, APC, and K-RAS; and to characterize the behavior of mutant KLF6 in colon-derived cell lines. Methods: We analyzed DNA isolated from 50 microdissected CRC cases, including 35 sporadic and 15 IBD-associated tumors. Microsatellite analysis and direct sequencing were used to establish the incidence of microsatellite instability, KLF6 and TP53 allelic imbalance, and KLF6, K-RAS, TP53, and APC mutation. Loss of growth suppressive function of the CRC-derived KLF6 mutants was characterized by in vitro thymidine incorporation assays and Western blotting. Results: KLF6 was inactivated by loss and/or mutation in most sporadic and IBD-related CRCs. The KLF6 locus was deleted in at least 55\% of tumors, and mutations were identified in 44\%. Rates of KLF6 loss and mutation were similar to those of TP53 and K-RAS in the same samples. KLF6 mutations were present in tumors with either microsatellite or chromosomal instability and were more common, particularly in the IBD-related cancers, in the presence of wild-type APC. Unlike wild-type KLF6, cancer-derived KLF6 mutants neither suppressed growth nor induced p21 following transfection into cultured cells. Conclusions: Deregulation of KLF6 by a combination of allelic imbalance and mutation may play a role in the development of CRC.},

Time series from single cell assays are particularly susceptible to confounding as the measurements are not averaged over populations of cells. When several genes are assayed in parallel these effects can be estimated and corrected for under certain smoothness assumptions on cell progression. , Results: We present a principled probabilistic model with a Bayesian inference scheme to analyse such data. We demonstrate our method's utility on public microarray, nCounter and RNA-seq datasets from three organisms. Our method almost perfectly recovers withheld capture times in an Arabidopsis dataset, it accurately estimates cell cycle peak times in a human prostate cancer cell line and it correctly identifies two precocious cells in a study of paracrine signalling in mouse dendritic cells. Furthermore, our method compares favourably with Monocle, a state-of-the-art technique. We also show using held-out data that uncertainty in the temporal dimension is a common confounder and should be accounted for in analyses of repeated cross-sectional time series., Availability and Implementation: Our method is available on CRAN in the DeLorean package., Contact: john.reid@mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk, Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Our laboratory has previously developed a retrospective method for reconstructing cell lineage trees from somatic mutations accumulated in microsatellites. This method was applied here to explore different aspects of stem cell dynamics in the mouse colon without the use of stem cell markers. We first demonstrated the reliability of our method for the study of stem cells by confirming previously established facts, and then we addressed open questions. Our findings confirmed that colon crypts are monoclonal and that, throughout adulthood, the process of monoclonal conversion plays a major role in the maintenance of crypts. The absence of immortal strand mechanism in crypts stem cells was validated by the age-dependent accumulation of microsatellite mutations. In addition, we confirmed the positive correlation between physical and lineage proximity of crypts, by showing that the colon is separated into small domains that share a common ancestor. We gained new data demonstrating that colon epithelium is clustered separately from hematopoietic and other cell types, indicating that the colon is constituted of few progenitors and ruling out significant renewal of colonic epithelium from hematopoietic cells during adulthood. Overall, our study demonstrates the reliability of cell lineage reconstruction for the study of stem cell dynamics, and it further addresses open questions in colon stem cells. In addition, this method can be applied to study stem cell dynamics in other systems.},

The highly-contiguous de novo assemblies using PacBio sequencing can close gaps in current reference assemblies and characterize structural variation (SV) in personal genomes. With longer reads, we can sequence through extended repetitive regions and detect mutations, many of which are associated with diseases. Moreover, PacBio transcriptome sequencing is advantageous for the identification of gene isoforms and facilitates reliable discoveries of novel genes and novel isoforms of annotated genes, due to its ability to sequence full-length transcripts or fragments with significant lengths. Additionally, PacBio's sequencing technique provides information that is useful for the direct detection of base modifications, such as methylation. In addition to using PacBio sequencing alone, many hybrid sequencing strategies have been developed to make use of more accurate short reads in conjunction with PacBio long reads. In general, hybrid sequencing strategies are more affordable and scalable especially for small-size laboratories than using PacBio Sequencing alone. The advent of PacBio sequencing has made available much information that could not be obtained via SGS alone.},

The present paper focuses on Sierra Leone, and provides cross sectional data on the least understood part of the epidemic{\textemdash}the largely undocumented spread of Ebola in rural areas. Various forms of social networking in rural communities and their relevance for understanding pathways of transmission are described. Particular attention is paid to the relationship between marriage, funerals and land tenure. Funerals are known to be a high-risk factor for infection. It is suggested that more than a shift in awareness of risks will be needed to change local patterns of behavior, especially in regard to funerals, since these are central to the consolidation of community ties. A concluding discussion relates the information presented to plans for halting the disease. Local consultation and access are seen as major challenges to be addressed.},

  abstract = {Transmission trees can be established through detailed contact histories, statistical inference, phylogenetic inference, or a combination of methods. Each method has its limitations, and the extent to which they succeed in revealing a `true' transmission history remains unclear. Moreover, the net value of pathogen sequencing in transmission tree reconstruction is yet to be assessed. We explored the accuracy and sensitivity to biases of a range of methods for transmission chain inference. We studied eight transmission chains determined by contact tracing, each one having more than a third of its cases sequenced (87 samples over 199 cases in total). We compared three inference methods on the selected transmission chains: (i) phylogenetic inference: the Ebola virus (EBOV) sequences derived from patients were mapped onto a dated EBOV phylogeny tree including 398 EBOV sequences sampled in Guinea between March 2014 and October 2015; (ii) statistical inference: we used the maximum likelihood framework developed by Wallinga and Teunis to infer the most likely transmitter-recipient relationships from the onset dates; (iii) combined method: we inferred probabilistic transmission events using both pathogen sequences and collection dates with the R package Outbreaker2. The cases coming from each transmission chain were mostly clustered together in the phylogenetic tree. The few misclassified cases were most likely allocated to the wrong chains of transmission because of the timing of their symptom onsets. Probabilistic transmission tree using only onset dates broadly matched the contact tracing data, but multiple potential infectors were identified for each case. The combined method showed that an a priori knowledge of the number of independent imports had an important impact on the outcome. Although cases were allocated to the correct transmission chains, discrepancies were found in identifying direct case linkage and transmission generations within a chain. Phylogenetic, epidemiological, and combined approaches for transmission chain reconstructions globally concurred in their output. Sequence data proved useful (if not necessary) to place the sampled cases in a wider context, identify transmission clusters, and misclassified cases when epidemiological chains are inferred from date of symptom onset only, and to identify links between supposedly independent chains of transmission.},

Much less attention is directed at understanding the landscape of deleterious variation, an insidious consequence of geographic isolation and the inefficiency of natural selection to eliminate harmful variants in small populations [3-5]. With population sizes of many vertebrates decreasing and isolation increasing through habitat fragmentation and loss, understanding the extent and nature of deleterious variation in small populations is essential for predicting and enhancing population persistence. The Channel Island fox (Urocyon littoralis) is a dwarfed species that inhabits six of California's Channel Islands and~is derived from the mainland gray fox (U.~cinereoargenteus). These isolated island populations have persisted for thousands of years at extremely small population sizes [6, 7] and, consequently, are a model for testing ideas about the accumulation of deleterious variation in small populations under natural conditions. Analysis of complete genome sequence data from island foxes shows a dramatic decrease in genome-wide variation and a sharp increase in the homozygosity of deleterious variants. The San Nicolas Island population has a near absence of variation, demonstrating a unique genetic flatlining that is punctuated by heterozygosity hotspots, enriched for olfactory receptor genes and other genes with high levels of ancestral variation. These findings question the generality of the small-population paradigm that maintains substantial genetic variation is necessary for short- and long-term persistence.},

  abstract = {Transient Receptor Potential Canonical (TRPC) proteins assemble to form calcium-permeable non-selective cationic channels. We previously showed that TRPC1 and TRPC5 are expressed by adipocytes and that their inhibition increased the concentration of circulating adiponectin, which is an important anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitising adipokine (Sukumar et al 2012, Circ Res 111, 191). The aim of this study was to investigate if the channels are relevant in hypercholesterolaemia. ApoE-knockout mice with conditional global expression of dominant-negative ion pore mutant TRPC5 (DNT5) were used to suppress ion permeation in the channels in vivo. Mice were fed with western-style diet and male litter-mates were compared with and without DNT5. Mice expressing DNT5 had significantly lower body weight compared to controls after 6 weeks and 12 weeks of treatment. Histological analysis showed significant reduction in adipocyte size. Quantitative RT-PC R analysis of adipose tissue showed that adiponectin mRNA was more abundant in the DNT5 group. By contrast, TNF-alpha and interleukin-6 mRNA were less abundant. No obvious adverse effects of DNT5 were evident. The data suggest that ion flux through heteromeric TRPC1/TRPC5 channels is a driver for weight gain, suppression of adiponectin gene expression and increased inflammation in hypercholesterolaemic mice. Therefore, inhibitors of the ion channels could be a strategy for protecting against obesity, insulin-resistance and inflammation. Supported by the Medical Research Council},

CAC is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The aim of the present review was to discuss the most important signaling pathways and genetic alterations involved in carcinogenesis related to IBD, focusing on the molecular aspects of cancer stem cell physiology and the impact of the inflammatory microenvironment. Molecular mechanisms involved in CAC development differ from those in sporadic colorectal cancer, reflecting the prominent role of inflammation-induced carcinogenesis in the development of CAC. The alteration of the physiological microenvironment is thought to be responsible for the initiation of carcinogenesis in IBD. Furthermore, cancer stem cells seem to have a fundamental role in the generation and growth of CAC. We also address prevention and treatment modalities of CAC and its involvement in IBD.},

In response to acute insult, group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) regulate intestinal stem cell maintenance and subsequent tissue repair. ILC3-derived IL-22 is important for stem cell protection, but the mechanisms of ILC3-driven tissue regeneration remain incompletely defined. Here we report that ILC3-driven epithelial proliferation and tissue regeneration are independent of IL-22. In contrast, ILC3s amplify the magnitude of HippoYap1 signaling in intestinal crypt cells, ensuring adequate initiation of tissue repair and preventing excessive pathology. Mechanistically, ILC3-driven tissue repair is Stat3 independent, but it involves activation of Src family kinases. Our findings reveal that ILC3-driven intestinal repair entails distinct transcriptional networks to control stem cell maintenance and epithelial regeneration, which implies that tissue repair and crypt proliferation can be influenced by targeting innate immune cells independent of the well-established effects of IL-22.},

In this study, we used simulation to explore the impact that the sequencing strategy and level of sequencing invest-ment have on the overall accuracy of imputation using hybrid peeling, a pedigree-based imputation method that is well suited for large livestock populations. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We simulated marker array and whole-genome sequence data for 15 populations with simulated or real pedigrees that had different structures. In these populations, we evaluated the effect on imputation accuracy of seven methods for selecting which individuals to sequence, the generation of the pedigree to which the sequenced individuals belonged, the use of variable or uniform coverage, and the trade-off between the number of sequenced individuals and their sequencing coverage. For each population, we considered four levels of investment in sequenc-ing that were proportional to the size of the population. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Imputation accuracy depended greatly on pedigree depth. The distribution of the sequenced individuals across the generations of the pedigree underlay the performance of the different methods used to select individuals to sequence and it was critical for achieving high imputation accuracy in both early and late generations. Imputation accuracy was highest with a uniform coverage across the sequenced individuals of\,2{\texttimes}\,rather than variable coverage. An investment equivalent to the cost of sequencing 2\% of the population at 2{\texttimes} provided high imputation accuracy. The gain in imputation accuracy from additional investment decreased with larger populations and higher levels of investment. However, to achieve the same imputation accuracy, a proportionally greater investment must be used in the smaller populations compared to the larger ones. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Suitable sequencing strategies for subsequent imputation with hybrid peeling involve sequenc-ing\,{\textasciitilde}2\% of the population at a uniform coverage\,2{\texttimes}, distributed preferably across all generations of the pedigree, except for the few earliest generations that lack genotyped ancestors. Such sequencing strategies are beneficial for generating whole-genome sequence data in populations with deep pedigrees of closely related individuals.},

Here we develop a method for computing and comparing codon-specific Ramachandran plots and demonstrate that the backbone dihedral angle distributions of some synonymous codons are distinguishable with statistical significance for some secondary structures. This shows that there exists a dependence between codon identity and backbone torsion of the translated amino acid. Although these findings cannot pinpoint the causal direction of this dependence, we discuss the vast biological implications should coding be shown to directly shape protein conformation and demonstrate the usefulness of this method as a tool for probing associations between codon usage and protein structure. Finally, we urge for the inclusion of exact genetic information into structural databases.},

PRESENTATION: A male patient was hospitalized when he was 18 days old for bloody diarrhea, which was diagnosed as Crohn's disease at 6 months old. He showed failure to thrive (FTT) and worsening inflammation while receiving enteral nutrition (EN) and standard IBD treatment. He was hospitalized in 2016, at 28 years old, for a Crohn's flare when sequencing confirmed a heterozygous mutation in IL10-RA. His weight and plasma micronutrient levels improved when he transitioned to parenteral nutrition (PN). He was initiated on anakinra while awaiting hematopoietic stem cell transplant, with substantial decrease in inflammation. He was able to gain weight, initiate an oral diet, and decrease his PN requirement. CONCLUSION: Our patient experienced progressive FTT while receiving EN. VEO-IBD incidence is rising, and its diagnosis is often delayed. Therefore, prompt recognition with treatment initiation is essential to improving nutrition outcomes in this patient population. Further investigation is warranted to determine whether these patients would benefit from early initiation of PN.},

Certain transition zones are especially prone to tumorigenesis an example being the anorectal junction, although the reason for this is not known. One possibility is that the abrupt transition of the simple columnar epithelium of the colon to the stratified squamous epithelium of the proximal portion of the anal canal may contain a unique stem cell niche. We investigated whether the anorectal region contained cells with stem cell properties relative to the adjacent epithelium. We utilized a tetracycline-regulatable histone H2B-GFP transgenic mice model, previously used to identify hair follicle stem cells, to fluorescently label slow-cycling anal epithelial cells (e.g., prospective stem cells) in combination with a panel of putative stem cell markers. We identified a population of long-term GFP label-retaining cells concentrated at the junction between the anal canal and the rectum. These cells are BrdU-retaining cells and expressed the stem cell marker CD34. Moreover, tracking the fate of the anal label-retaining cells in vivo revealed that the slow-cycling cells only gave rise to progeny of the anal epithelium. In conclusion, we identified a unique population of cells at the anorectal junction which can be separated from the other basal anal epithelial cells based upon the expression of the stem cell marker CD34 and integrin {$\alpha$}6, and thus represent a putative anal stem cell population.},

  abstract = {Background \& Aims: Patients with ulcerative colitis are at increased risk of colorectal cancer. It is widely believed that this is secondary to colonic inflammation. However, the severity of colonic inflammation has never been shown to be a risk factor. Methods: We devised a case-control study of patients with long-standing extensive ulcerative colitis to examine various potential risk factors for neoplasia. All cases of colorectal neoplasia detected from our surveillance program between January 1, 1988, and January 1, 2002, were studied (n = 68). Each patient was matched with 2 control patients from the same surveillance population (n = 136). Matching was for sex, colitis extent, age at onset, duration of colitis, and year of index surveillance colonoscopy. Segmental colonoscopic and histological inflammation was recorded by using a simple score (0, normal; 1, quiescent/chronic inflammation; and 2, 3, and 4, mild, moderate, and severe active inflammation, respectively). Other data collected included history of primary sclerosing cholangitis, family history of colorectal cancer, and smoking and drug history (mesalamine 5-aminosalicylic acid, azathioprine, and folate). Results: Univariate analysis showed a highly significant correlation between the colonoscopic (odds ratio, 2.5; P = 0.001) and histological (odds ratio, 5.1; P {$<$} 0.001) inflammation scores and the risk of colorectal neoplasia. No other factors reached statistical significance. On multivariate analysis, only the histological inflammation score remained significant (odds ratio, 4.7; P {$<$} 0.001). Conclusions: In long-standing extensive ulcerative colitis, the severity of colonic inflammation is an important determinant of the risk of colorectal neoplasia. Endoscopic and histological grading of inflammation could allow better risk stratification for surveillance programs.},

  abstract = {Heterogeneity in human diseases presents challenges in diagnosis and treatments due to the broad range of manifestations and symptoms. With the rapid development of labelled multi-omic data, integrative machine learning methods have achieved breakthroughs in treatments by redefining these diseases at a more granular level. These approaches often have limitations in scalability, oversimplification, and handling of missing data. In this study, we introduce Multi-Omic Graph Diagnosis (MOGDx), a flexible command line tool for the integration of multi-omic data to perform classification tasks for heterogeneous diseases. MOGDx is a network integrative method that combines patient similarity networks with a reduced vector representation of genomic data. The reduced vector is derived from the latent embeddings of an auto-encoder and the combined network is fed into a graph convolutional network for classification. MOGDx was evaluated on three datasets from the cancer genome atlas for breast invasive carcinoma, kidney cancer, and low grade glioma. MOGDx demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and an ability to identify relevant multi-omic markers in each task. It did so while integrating more genomic measures with greater patient coverage compared to other network integrative methods. MOGDx is available to download from https://github.com/biomedicalinformaticsgroup/MOGDx. Overall, MOGDx is a promising tool for integrating multi-omic data, classifying heterogeneous diseases, and interpreting genomic markers.},

Here, we benchmark 45 of these methods on 110 real and 229 synthetic datasets for cellular ordering, topology, scalability and usability. Our results highlight the complementarity of existing tools, and that the choice of method should depend mostly on the dataset dimensions and trajectory topology. Based on these results, we develop a set of guidelines to help users select the best method for their dataset.

Here, we present TreeTime, a Python-based framework for phylodynamic analysis using an approximate Maximum Likelihood approach. TreeTime can estimate ancestral states, infer evolution models, reroot trees to maximize temporal signals, estimate molecular clock phylogenies and population size histories.

To investigate its role in other adult stem cell populations, we generated a mouse expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre from the Bmi1 locus. We found that Bmi1 is expressed in discrete cells located near the bottom of crypts in the small intestine, predominantly four cells above the base of the crypt (+4 position). Over time, these cells proliferate, expand, self-renew and give rise to all the differentiated cell lineages of the small intestine epithelium. The induction of a stable form of beta-catenin in these cells was sufficient to rapidly generate adenomas. Moreover, ablation of Bmi1(+) cells using a Rosa26 conditional allele, expressing diphtheria toxin, led to crypt loss. These experiments identify Bmi1 as an intestinal stem cell marker in vivo. Unexpectedly, the distribution of Bmi1-expressing stem cells along the length of the small intestine suggested that mammals use more than one molecularly distinguishable adult stem cell subpopulation to maintain organ homeostasis.},

Small intestinal Paneth cells supply Wnt3, EGF, and Notch signals to neighboring Lgr5(+) stem cells. Whereas the colon lacks Paneth cells, deep crypt secretory (DCS) cells are intermingled with Lgr5(+) stem cells at crypt bottoms. Here, we report regenerating islet-derived family member 4 (Reg4) as a marker of DCS cells. To investigate a niche function, we eliminated DCS cells by using the diphtheria-toxin receptor gene knocked into the murine Reg4 locus. Ablation of DCS cells results in loss of stem cells from colonic crypts and disrupts gut homeostasis and colon organoid growth. In agreement, sorted Reg4(+) DCS cells promote organoid formation of single Lgr5(+) colon stem cells. DCS cells can be massively produced from Lgr5(+) colon stem cells in vitro by combined Notch inhibition and Wnt activation. We conclude that Reg4(+) DCS cells serve as Paneth cell equivalents in the colon crypt niche.},

UC-associated carcinogenesis presents a different sequence of tumorigenic events compared to those that contribute to the development of sporadic colorectal cancer. In fact, in UC, the early events are represented by oxidative DNA damage and DNA methylation that can produce an inhibition of oncosuppressor genes, mutation of p53, aneuploidy, and microsatellite instability. Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor and DNA mismatch repair gene promoter regions is an epigenetic mechanism of gene silencing that contribute to tumorigenesis and may represent the first step in inflammatory carcinogenesis. Moreover, p53 is frequently mutated in the early stages of UC-associated cancer. Aneuploidy is an independent risk factor for forthcoming carcinogenesis in UC. Epithelial cell-T-cell cross-talk mediated by CD80 is a key factor in controlling the progression from low to high grade dysplasia in UC-associated carcinogenesis.},

  abstract = {Colitis is a major risk factor for the development of colorectal cancer, leading to colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). The most commonly used animal model to study CAC is the azoxymethane-dextran sulphate-sodium (AOM/DSS) model. The ideal experimental conditions of this model depend on several factors, including the used mouse strain. No data on feasibility and conditions for older mice, e.g., for aging studies, have yet been reported. Thus, we conducted a descriptive, observational pilot study where CAC was induced in 14-month-old female Balb/C and C57/Bl6 mice using 12.5 mg/kg AOM i.p. and three different concentrations of DSS (1, 2, and 3\%) in drinking water (ad. lib.). The mice were monitored regularly during the three-month experimental phase. After euthanasia, the colons of the mice were evaluated macroscopically and microscopically. Both the mouse strains showed a DSS-concentration-dependent induction of CAC. Carcinomas were only observed at 3\% DSS. The DSS dose was found to be significantly correlated with the histology score and \% Ki67 positive cells only in C57/Bl6 mice but not in Balb/C mice, which showed a variable response to the CAC induction. No differences in colon length, weight, or mucin content were observed. Optimal conditions for CAC induction in these aged animals are thus considered to be 3\% DSS, as carcinomas did not develop when 2\% DSS was used. On the other hand, Balb/C mice reacted severely to 3\% DSS, indicating that 2.5\% DSS may be the ``sweet spot'' for future experiments comparing CAC in aged Balb/C and C57/Bl6 mice. This model will allow investigation of the effect of aging on CAC development and therapy.},

However, we here show that Pseudomonas koreensis P19E3 harbors multiple, near identical repeat pairs up to 70 kilobase pairs in length, which contained several genes that may confer fitness advantages to the strain. Its complex genome, which also included a variable shufflon region, could not be de novo assembled with long reads produced by Pacific Biosciences' technology, but required very long reads from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Importantly, a repeat analysis, whose results we release for over 9600 prokaryotes, indicated that very complex bacterial genomes represent a general phenomenon beyond Pseudomonas. Roughly 10\% of 9331 complete bacterial and a handful of 293 complete archaeal genomes represented this `dark matter' for de novo genome assembly of prokaryotes. Several of these `dark matter' genome assemblies contained repeats far beyond the resolution of the sequencing technology employed and likely contain errors, other genomes were closed employing labor-intense steps like cosmid libraries, primer walking or optical mapping. Using very long sequencing reads in combination with assembly algorithms capable of resolving long, near identical repeats will bring most prokaryotic genomes within reach of fast and complete de novo genome assembly.},

Although many studies have reported on the regenerative response of intestinal progenitor and stem cells to tissue injury, very little is known about the response of differentiated lineages to inflammatory cues. Here, we show that acute inflammation of the mouse small intestine is followed by a dramatic loss of Lgr5+ stem cells. Instead, Paneth cells re-enter the cell cycle, lose their secretory expression signature, and acquire stem-like properties, thus contributing to the tissue regenerative response to inflammation. Stem cell factor secretion upon inflammation triggers signaling through the c-Kit receptor and a cascade of downstream events culminating in GSK3{$\beta$} inhibition and Wnt activation in Paneth cells. Hence, the plasticity of the intestinal epithelium in response to inflammation goes well beyond stem and progenitor cells and extends to the fully differentiated and post-mitotic Paneth cells.},

  abstract = {Discrete phylogeography using software such as BEAST considers the sampling location of each taxon as fixed; often to a single location without uncertainty. When studying viruses, this implies that there is no possibility that the location of the infected host for that taxa is somewhere else. Here, we relaxed this strong assumption and allowed for analytic integration of uncertainty for discrete virus phylogeography. We used automatic language processing methods to find and assign uncertainty to alternative potential locations. We considered two influenza case studies: H5N1 in Egypt; H1N1 pdm09 in North America. For each, we implemented scenarios in which 25 per cent of the taxa had different amounts of sampling uncertainty including 10, 30, and 50 per cent uncertainty and varied how it was distributed for each taxon. This includes scenarios that: (i) placed a specific amount of uncertainty on one location while uniformly distributing the remaining amount across all other candidate locations (correspondingly labeled 10, 30, and 50); (ii) assigned the remaining uncertainty to just one other location; thus `splitting' the uncertainty among two locations (i.e. 10/90, 30/70, and 50/50); and (iii) eliminated uncertainty via two predefined heuristic approaches: assignment to a centroid location (CNTR) or the largest population in the country (POP). We compared all scenarios to a reference standard (RS) in which all taxa had known (absolutely certain) locations. From this, we implemented five random selections of 25 per cent of the taxa and used these for specifying uncertainty. We performed posterior analyses for each scenario, including: (a) virus persistence, (b) migration rates, (c) trunk rewards, and (d) the posterior probability of the root state. The scenarios with sampling uncertainty were closer to the RS than CNTR and POP. For H5N1, the absolute error of virus persistence had a median range of 0.005{\textendash}0.047 for scenarios with sampling uncertainty{\textemdash}(i) and (ii) above{\textemdash}versus a range of 0.063{\textendash}0.075 for CNTR and POP. Persistence for the pdm09 case study followed a similar trend as did our analyses of migration rates across scenarios (i) and (ii). When considering the posterior probability of the root state, we found all but one of the H5N1 scenarios with sampling uncertainty had agreement with the RS on the origin of the outbreak whereas both CNTR and POP disagreed. Our results suggest that assigning geospatial uncertainty to taxa benefits estimation of virus phylogeography as compared to ad-hoc heuristics. We also found that, in general, there was limited difference in results regardless of how the sampling uncertainty was assigned; uniform distribution or split between two locations did not greatly impact posterior results. This framework is available in BEAST v.1.10. In future work, we will explore viruses beyond influenza. We will also develop a web interface for researchers to use our language processing methods to find and assign uncertainty to alternative potential locations for virus phylogeography.},

  abstract = {The natural history of cancers can be understood through the lens of evolution given that the driving forces of cancer development are mutation and selection of fitter clones. Cancer growth and progression are spatial processes that involve the breakdown of normal tissue organization, invasion and metastasis. For these reasons, spatial patterns are an integral part of histological tumour grading and staging as they measure the progression from normal to malignant disease. Furthermore, tumour cells are part of an ecosystem of tumour cells and their surrounding tumour microenvironment. A range of new spatial genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic technologies offers new avenues for the study of cancer evolution with great molecular and spatial detail. These methods enable precise characterizations of the tumour microenvironment, cellular interactions therein and micro-anatomical structures. In conjunction with spatial genomics, it emerges that tumours and microenvironments co-evolve, which helps explain observable patterns of heterogeneity and offers new routes for therapeutic interventions. In this Review, the authors discuss our latest understanding of the spatial aspects of cancer evolution, including the roles of cancer subclonal structure, tissue architecture, and interactions between cancer cells and diverse cell types of the microenvironment at local and distant sites.},

This control is achieved in part by the organ structure itself, such that neighboring cells influence each other's identity. However, large-scale investigation of the cellular interactome has been technically challenging. Here, we develop CIM-seq, an unsupervised and highthroughput method to analyze direct physical cell-cell interactions between every cell type in a given tissue. CIM-seq is based on RNA sequencing of incompletely dissociated cells, followed by computational deconvolution of these into their constituent cell types using machine learning. We use CIM-seq to define the cell interaction landscape of the mouse small intestinal and colonic epithelium, uncovering both known and novel interactions. Specifically, we find that the general architecture of the stem cell niche is radically different between the two tissues. In small intestine, the stem-Paneth cell interaction forms an exceptionally strong and exclusive niche, in which Paneth cells provide Wnt ligands1. In colonic epithelium, no similar compartment exists to support stem cells, and Wnt signaling is provided by a mesenchymal cell layer2,3. However, colonic stem cells are supported by an adjacent, previously unrecognized goblet cell subtype expressing the wound-healing marker Plet1, which is also highly upregulated during regeneration of colon epithelium. These results identify novel cellular interactions specific for the colonic stem cell niche and suggest an additional level of structural control in the colon. CIM-seq is broadly applicable to studies that aim to simultaneously investigate the constituent cell types and the global interaction profile in a specific tissue.},

Given the fact that the prevalence of this disease is higher at younger ages and that it disrupts half the life of the patient, it will, most likely, become a major health problem in the near future, even in developing countries.

Ongoing evaluation of the epidemiological characteristics and future course of the Ebola outbreak is needed to stay abreast of any changes to its transmission dynamics, as well as the success or failure of intervention efforts. Here we use observations, dynamic modeling and Bayesian inference to generate simulations and weekly forecasts of the outbreaks in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Estimates of key epidemiological characteristics over time indicate continued epidemic growth in West Africa, though there is some evidence of slowing growth in Liberia. 6-week forecasts over successive weeks corroborate these findings; forecasts projecting no future change in intervention efficacy have been more accurate for Guinea and Sierra Leone, but have overestimated incidence and mortality for Liberia.},

Current study reports the highly accurate complete genomes of two clinical B. pertussis strains from India for the first time. Methods: Complete genome sequencing was performed for two B. pertussis strains using Ion Torrent PGM and Oxford nanopore sequencing method. Data was assembled de novo and the sequence annotation was performed through PATRIC and NCBI server. Downstream analyses of the isolates were performed using CGE server databases for antimicrobial resistance genes, plasmids, and sequence types. The phylogenetic analysis was performed using Roary. Results: The analysis revealed insertional elements flanked by IS481, which has been previously regarded as the important component for bacterial evolution. The two B. pertussis clinical strains exhibited diversity through genome degradation when compared to whole-cell vaccine reference strains of India. These isolates harboured multiple genetic virulence traits and toxin subunits, which belonged to sequence type ST2. Conclusion: The genome information of Indian clinical B. pertussis strains will serve as a baseline data to decipher more information on the genome evolution, virulence factors and their role in pathogenesis for effective vaccine strategies.},

The lack of resources for infection control and personal protective equipment are the main reasons for nosocomial transmission.

These components include (1) the possible states of a promoter, where a state is defined as a particular arrangement of transcription factors bound to a DNA promoter, (2) the binding constants that describe the affinity of the protein{\textendash}protein and protein{\textendash}DNA interactions that occur in each state, and (3) whether each state is capable of transcribing. Using these components, we demonstrate how to compute a cis-regulatory function that encodes the probability of a promoter being active. Our intention is to provide enough detail so that readers with little background in thermodynamics can compose their own cis-regulatory functions. To facilitate this goal, we also describe a matrix form of the model that can be easily coded in any programming language. This formalism has great flexibility, which we show by illustrating how phenomena such as competition between transcription factors and cooperativity are readily incorporated into these models. Using this framework, we also demonstrate that Michaelis-like functions, another class of cis-regulatory models, are a subset of the thermodynamic framework with specific assumptions. By recasting Michaelis-like functions as thermodynamic functions, we emphasize the relationship between these models and delineate the specific circumstances representable by each approach. Application of thermodynamic state ensemble models is likely to be an important tool in unraveling the physical basis of combinatorial cis-regulation and in generating formalisms that accurately predict gene expression from DNA sequence.},

A total of 1,660,290 new cancer cases and 580,350 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States in 2013. During the most recent 5 years for which there are data (2005-2009), delay-adjusted cancer incidence rates declined slightly in men (by 0.6\% per year) and were stable in women, while cancer death rates decreased by 1.8\% per year in men and by 1.5\% per year in women. Overall, cancer death rates have declined 20\% from their peak in 1991 (215.1 per 100,000 population) to 2009 (173.1 per 100,000 population). Death rates continue to decline for all 4 major cancer sites (lung, colorectum, breast, and prostate). Over the past 10 years of data (2000-2009), the largest annual declines in death rates were for chronic myeloid leukemia (8.4\%), cancers of the stomach (3.1\%) and colorectum (3.0\%), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (3.0\%). The reduction in overall cancer death rates since 1990 in men and 1991 in women translates to the avoidance of approximately 1.18 million deaths from cancer, with 152,900 of these deaths averted in 2009 alone. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population, with an emphasis on those groups in the lowest socioeconomic bracket and other underserved populations.},

As of 29 April 2015, there have been 26,277 reported total cases (of which 14,895 have been laboratory confirmed) resulting in 10,899 deaths. The source of the outbreak was traced to the prefecture of Gu{\'e}ck{\'e}dou in the forested region of southeastern Guinea. The virus later spread to the capital, Conakry, and to the neighbouring countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Mali. In March 2014, when the first cases were detected in Conakry, the Institut Pasteur of Dakar, Senegal, deployed a mobile laboratory in Donka hospital to provide diagnostic services to the greater Conakry urban area and other regions of Guinea. Through this process we sampled 85 Ebola viruses (EBOV) from patients infected from July to November 2014, and report their full genome sequences here. Phylogenetic analysis reveals the sustained transmission of three distinct viral lineages co-circulating in Guinea, including the urban setting of Conakry and its surroundings. One lineage is unique to Guinea and closely related to the earliest sampled viruses of the epidemic. A second lineage contains viruses probably reintroduced from neighbouring Sierra Leone on multiple occasions, while a third lineage later spread from Guinea to Mali. Each lineage is defined by multiple mutations, including non-synonymous changes in the virion protein 35 (VP35), glycoprotein (GP) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) proteins. The viral GP is characterized by a glycosylation site modification and mutations in the mucin-like domain that could modify the outer shape of the virion. These data illustrate the ongoing ability of EBOV to develop lineage-specific and potentially phenotypically important variation.},

RNA regulators like riboswitches play significant role in controlling the gene expression in prokaryotes. The taxonomic distribution of riboswitches suggests that they might be one of the oldest mechanisms of gene control system. In this paper, we analyzed the distribution of different riboswitch families in various cyanobacterial genomes. It was observed that only four riboswitch classes were abundant in cyanobacteria, B12-element (Cob)/AdoCbl/AdoCbl-variant riboswitch being the most abundant. The analysis suggests that riboswitch mode of regulation is present in cyanobacterial species irrespective of their habitat types. A large number of unidentified genes regulated by riboswitches listed in this analysis indicate the wide range of targets for these riboswitch families. The analysis revealed a large number of genes regulated by riboswitches which may assist in elaborating the diversity among the cyanobacterial species.},

We identified novel compartment-specific markers as well as dramatic aging-associated changes in cell composition and signaling pathways, including a shift from absorptive to secretory epithelial cells, depletion of naive lymphocytes, and induction of eIF2 signaling. Colon cancer is one of the leading causes of death within the western world, incidence of which increases with age. The colonic epithelium is a rapidly renewing tissue, tasked with water and nutrient absorption, as well as hosting intestinal microbes. The colonic submucosa is populated with immune cells interacting with and regulating the epithelial cells. However, it is unknown whether compartment-specific changes occur during aging and what impact this would cause. We show that both epithelial and immune cells differ significantly between colonic compartments and experience significant age-related changes in mice. We found a shift in the absorptive-secretory cell balance, possibly linked to age-associated intestinal disturbances, such as malabsorption. We demonstrate marked changes in aging immune cells: population shifts and interactions with epithelial cells, linking cytokines (Ifn-{$\gamma$}, Il1B) with the aging of colonic epithelium. Our results provide new insights into the normal and age-associated states of the colon.},

Unlike population-based RNA sequencing approaches, scRNA seq necessitates comprehensive computational tools to address high data complexity and keep up with the emerging single-cell associated challenges.

Inflammatory fibroblasts, inflammatory monocytes, microfold-like cells, and T cells that co-express CD8 and IL-17 expand with disease, forming intercellular interaction hubs. Many UC risk genes are cell type specific and co-regulated within relatively few gene modules, suggesting convergence onto limited sets of cell types and pathways. Using this observation, we nominate and infer functions for specific risk genes across GWAS loci.

Whether sublethal chemotherapy affects tumor cell behavior and impacts on patient outcome is primarily unstudied. We now show that sublethal chemotherapy imposes a quiescent-like state to p53 wildtype human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells that is linked to the acquisition of a fetal phenotype downstream of YAP1, similar to that observed after intestinal damage. CRC cells displaying this fetal phenotype exhibit tumor- initiating activity comparable to untreated cells but superior metastatic capacity. Notably, nuclear YAP1 accumulation, or detection of the fetal signature in tumors predict poor prognosis in CRC patients carrying p53 wildtype tumors. Collectively, our results uncover a potential adverse response of tumor cells to suboptimal chemotherapy, and identify nuclear YAP1 and fetal conversion of colorectal tumors as biomarkers for prognosis and therapy prescription. Statement of significance Chemotherapy induces a quiescent-like phenotype to colorectal cancer cells that is linked to the acquisition of a YAP1-dependent fetal signature. Notably, this signature is predictive of patient outcome in different cohorts of human colorectal cancer.},

Whether and how non-curative DNA damage-based treatment affects tumor cell behavior and patient outcome is primarily unstudied. Using CRC patient-derived organoids (PDO)s, we show that sublethal doses of chemotherapy (CT) does not select previously resistant tumor populations but induces a quiescent state specifically to TP53 wildtype (WT) cancer cells, which is linked to the acquisition of a YAP1-dependent fetal phenotype. Cells displaying this phenotype exhibit high tumor-initiating and metastatic activity. Nuclear YAP1 and fetal traits are present in a proportion of tumors at diagnosis and predict poor prognosis in patients carrying TP53 WT CRC tumors. We provide data indicating the higher efficacy of CT together with YAP1 inhibitors for eradication of therapy resistant TP53 WT cancer cells. Together these results identify fetal conversion as a useful biomarker for patient prognosis and therapy prescription.},

Genomics England, alongside NHS England, analyzed WGS data from 13,880 solid tumors spanning 33 cancer types, integrating genomic data with real-world treatment and outcome data, within a secure Research Environment. Incidence of somatic mutations in genes recommended for standard-of-care testing varied across cancer types. For instance, in glioblastoma multiforme, small variants were present in 94\% of cases and copy number aberrations in at least one gene in 58\% of cases, while sarcoma demonstrated the highest occurrence of actionable structural variants (13\%). Homologous recombination deficiency was identified in 40\% of high-grade serous ovarian cancer cases with 30\% linked to pathogenic germline variants, highlighting the value of combined somatic and germline analysis. The linkage of WGS and longitudinal life course clinical data allowed the assessment of treatment outcomes for patients stratified according to pangenomic markers. Our findings demonstrate the utility of linking genomic and real-world clinical data to enable survival analysis to identify cancer genes that affect prognosis and advance our understanding of how cancer genomics impacts patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND METHODOLOGY: The current Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa has been spreading at least since December 2013. The first confirmed case of Ebola virus in Sierra Leone was identified on May 25. Based on viral genetic sequencing data from 72 individuals in Sierra Leone collected between the end of May and mid June, we utilize a range of phylodynamic methods to estimate the basic reproductive number (R0). We additionally estimate the expected lengths of the incubation and infectious periods of the virus. Finally, we use phylogenetic trees to examine the role played by population structure in the epidemic. RESULTS: The median estimates of R0 based on sequencing data alone range between 1.65-2.18, with the most plausible model yielding a median R0 of 2.18 (95\% HPD 1.24-3.55). Importantly, our results indicate that, at least until mid June, relief efforts in Sierra Leone were ineffective at lowering the effective reproductive number of the virus. We estimate the expected length of the infectious period to be 2.58 days (median; 95\% HPD 1.24-6.98). The dataset appears to be too small in order to estimate the incubation period with high certainty (median expected incubation period 4.92 days; 95\% HPD 2.11-23.20). While our estimates of the duration of infection tend to be smaller than previously reported, phylodynamic analyses support a previous estimate that 70\% of cases were observed and included in the present dataset. The dataset is too small to show a particular population structure with high significance, however our preliminary analyses suggest that half the population is spreading the virus with an R0 well above 2, while the other half of the population is spreading with an R0 below 1. CONCLUSIONS: Overall we show that sequencing data can robustly infer key epidemiological parameters. Such estimates inform public health officials and help to coordinate effective public health efforts. Thus having more sequencing data available for the ongoing Ebola virus epidemic and at the start of new outbreaks will foster a quick understanding of the dynamics of the pathogen.},

It is unclear to what extent the functional specialization of the striatum is due to the molecular specialization of SPN subtypes. We sought to define the molecular and anatomical diversity of adult SPNs using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and quantitative RNA in situ hybridization (ISH). We computationally distinguished discrete versus continuous heterogeneity in scRNA-seq data and found that SPNs in the striatum can be classified into four major discrete types with no implied spatial relationship between them. Within these discrete types, we find continuous heterogeneity encoding spatial gradients of gene expression and defining anatomical location in a combinatorial mechanism. Our results suggest that neuronal circuitry has a substructure at far higher resolution than is typically interrogated, which is defined by the precise identity and location of a neuron.},

We present VIA, a scalable trajectory inference algorithm that overcomes these limitations by using lazy-teleporting random walks to accurately reconstruct complex cellular trajectories beyond tree-like pathways (e.g., cyclic or disconnected structures). We show that VIA robustly and efficiently unravels the fine-grained sub-trajectories in a 1.3-million-cell transcriptomic mouse atlas without losing the global connectivity at such a high cell count. We further apply VIA to discovering elusive lineages and less populous cell fates missed by other methods across a variety of data types, including single-cell proteomic, epigenomic, multi-omics datasets, and a new in-house single-cell morphological dataset.},

  abstract = {Intestinal ischemia is a life-threatening emergency with mortality rates of 50\%-80\% due to epithelial cell death and resultant barrier loss. Loss of the epithelial barrier occurs in conditions including intestinal volvulus and neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis. Survival depends on effective epithelial repair; crypt-based intestinal epithelial stem cells (ISCs) are the source of epithelial renewal in homeostasis and after injury. Two ISC populations have been described: 1) active ISC [aISC; highly proliferative; leucine-rich-repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5+)-positive or sex-determining region Y-box 9 -antigen Ki67-positive (SOX9+Ki67+)] and 2) reserve ISC [rISC; less proliferative; homeodomain-only protein X positive (HOPX+)]. The contributions of these ISCs have been evaluated both in vivo and in vitro using a porcine model of mesenteric vascular occlusion to understand mechanisms that modulate ISC recovery responses following ischemic injury. In our previously published work, we observed that rISC conversion to an activated state was associated with decreased HOPX expression during in vitro recovery. In the present study, we wanted to evaluate the direct role of HOPX on cellular proliferation during recovery after injury. Our data demonstrated that during early in vivo recovery, injury-resistant HOPX+ cells maintain quiescence. Subsequent early regeneration within the intestinal crypt occurs around 2 days after injury, a period in which HOPX expression decreased. When HOPX was silenced in vitro, cellular proliferation of injured cells was promoted during recovery. This suggests that HOPX may serve a functional role in ISC-mediated regeneration after injury and could be a target to control ISC proliferation.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY This paper supports that rISCs are resistant to ischemic injury and likely an important source of cellular renewal following near-complete epithelial loss. Furthermore, we have evidence that HOPX controls ISC activity state and may be a critical signaling pathway during ISC-mediated repair. Finally, we use multiple novel methods to evaluate ISCs in a translationally relevant large animal model of severe intestinal injury and provide evidence for the potential role of rISCs as therapeutic targets.},

  abstract = {Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at significantly increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), principally resulting from the pro-neoplastic effects of chronic intestinal inflammation. Epidemiologic studies continue to highlight the increased risk of CRC in IBD. However, the incidence has declined over the past 30 years, attributed to both successful CRC-surveillance programs and improved control of mucosal inflammation. Risk factors that further increase the risk of IBD-related CRC include disease duration, extent and severity, the presence of inflammatory pseudopolyps, coexistent primary sclerosing cholangitis, and a family history of CRC. All major professional societies agree that IBD-CRC surveillance should occur more frequently than in the general population. Yet, guidelines and consensus statements differ on the surveillance schedule and preferred method of surveillance. Improved sensitivity to previously ``invisible'' flat dysplastic lesions using high definition and chromoendoscopy methods has resulted in many guidelines abandoning requirements for random untargeted biopsies of the colon. While colonic dysplasia remains a worrisome finding, and several clinical scenarios remain best addressed by total proctocolectomy due to concerns of synchronous undetected lesions and the unpredictable tempo of progression to malignancy, better detection techniques have also increased opportunities for endoscopic resection of dysplastic lesions that can be clearly delineated. Finally, the expanding armamentarium of medical options in IBD, including anti-tumor necrosis factor and anti-adhesion biologic therapies, have substantially improved our ability to control severe inflammation and likely reduce the risk of CRC over time.},

Here, we developed a method able to retroactively determine the error rate of most public sequencing datasets. To do this, we utilized the overlaps between reads that are a feature of many sequencing libraries. With this method, we surveyed 1943 different datasets from seven different sequencing instruments produced by Illumina. We show that among public datasets, the more expensive platforms like HiSeq and NovaSeq have a lower error rate and less variation. But we also discovered that there is great variation within each platform, with the accuracy of a sequencing experiment depending greatly on the experimenter. We show the importance of sequence context, especially the phenomenon where preceding bases bias the following bases toward the same identity. We also show the difference in patterns of sequence bias between instruments. Contrary to expectations based on the underlying chemistry, HiSeq X Ten and NovaSeq 6000 share notable exceptions to the preceding-base bias. Our results demonstrate the importance of the specific circumstances of every sequencing experiment, and the importance of evaluating the quality of each one.},

This is the first reconciliation algorithm to capture all four evolutionary processes driving tree incongruence and the first to reconcile non-binary species trees with a transfer model. Our algorithm infers all optimal solutions and reports complete, temporally feasible event histories, giving the gene and species lineages in which each event occurred. It is fixed-parameter tractable, with polytime complexity when the maximum species outdegree is fixed. Application of our algorithms to prokaryotic and eukaryotic data show that use of an incomplete event model has substantial impact on the events inferred and resulting biological conclusions.AvailabilityOur algorithms have been implemented in Notung, a freely available phylogenetic reconciliation software package, available at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/{\textasciitilde}durand/Notung.Contactmstolzer@andrew.cmu.edu.},

As new methods arise to measure distinct cellular modalities, a key analytical challenge is to integrate these datasets to better understand cellular identity and function. Here, we develop a strategy to ``anchor'' diverse datasets together, enabling us to integrate single-cell measurements not only across scRNA-seq technologies, but also across different modalities. After demonstrating improvement over existing methods for integrating scRNA-seq data, we anchor scRNA-seq experiments with scATAC-seq to explore chromatin differences in closely related interneuron subsets and project protein expression measurements onto a bone marrow atlas to characterize lymphocyte populations. Lastly, we harmonize in situ gene expression and scRNA-seq datasets, allowing transcriptome-wide imputation of spatial gene expression patterns. Our work presents a strategy for the assembly of harmonized references and transfer of information across datasets.},

We devised a novel strategy to create an antigen receptor feature space that can be used for both differential V(D)J usage analysis and pseudotime trajectory inference. The application of Dandelion improved the alignment of human thymic development trajectories of double positive T cells to mature single-positive CD4/CD8 T cells, with important new predictions of factors regulating lineage commitment. Dandelion analysis of other cell compartments provided novel insights into the origins of human B1 cells and ILC/NK cell development, illustrating the power of our approach.

An example of a common pleiotropic disease that could benefit from miRNA-based therapeutics is inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is characterized by chronic inflammation of the small and large intestines. Due to complex interactions between multiple factors in the etiology of IBD, development of therapies that effectively maintain remission for this disease is a significant challenge.

The advent of protein and DNA sequencing{\textemdash}most notably the use of 16S ribosomal RNA{\textemdash}defined a new level of classification that now forms our basic understanding of the history of life on earth. High-throughput sequencing currently provides DNA sequences at an unprecedented rate, not only providing a wealth of information but also posing considerable analytical challenges. Here we present comparative genomics{\textendash}based methods useful for automating evolutionary analysis between any number of species. As a practical example, we applied our method to the well-studied cyanobacterial lineage. The 24 cyanobacterial genomes compared here occupy a wide variety of environmental niches and play major roles in global carbon and nitrogen cycles. By integrating phylogenetic data inferred for upward of 1,000 protein-coding genes common to all or most cyanobacteria, we have reconstructed an evolutionary history of the phylum, establishing a framework for resolving key issues regarding the evolution of their metabolic and phenotypic diversity. Greater resolution on individual branches can be attained by telescoping inward to the larger set of conserved proteins between fewer taxa. The construction of all individual protein phylogenies allows for quantitative tree scoring, providing insight into the evolutionary history of each protein family as well as probing the limits of phylogenetic resolution. The tools incorporated here are fast, computationally tractable, and easily extendable to other phyla and provide a scaleable framework for contrasting and integrating the information present in thousands of protein-coding genes within related genomes.},

Moreover, extensive chromosome polymorphisms were described in some species. In the red fox and raccoon dog a variable number of B chromosomes exist, while in the arctic fox such variability is caused by the widely spread Robertsonian translocation. Also size polymorphism of heterochromatic arms appears in the arctic fox. During the last ten years very rapid progress has been achieved in the mapping of the dog genome and it has facilitated the construction of genome maps of other canids, as well. The application of the comparative chromosome painting approach and the analysis of the chromosome localisation of marker loci have facilitated detailed studies on chromosome rearrangements which occurred during the karyotype evolution. It is foreseen that the extended knowledge on the canine genome organisation will be useful not only in the detection of gene mutations causing hereditary diseases in the dog, but also will facilitate the identification of genes responsible for the great phenotypic and behavioural variability of the dog breeds. Potentially this knowledge may also be useful in fur animal breeding.},

Intestinal organoids offer a model of self-organization as they generate stem cell zones (SCZs) of typical size even without a spatially structured environment. Here we examine processes governing the size of SCZs. We improve the viability and homogeneity of intestinal organoid cultures to enable long-term time-lapse imaging of multiple organoids in parallel. We find that SCZs are shaped by fission events under strong control of ion channel-mediated inflation and mechanosensitive Piezo-family channels. Fission occurs through stereotyped modes of dynamic behavior that differ in their coordination of budding and differentiation. Imaging and single-cell transcriptomics show that inflation drives acute stem cell differentiation and induces a stretch-responsive cell state characterized by large transcriptional changes, including upregulation of Piezo1. Our results reveal an intrinsic capacity of the intestinal epithelium to self-organize by modulating and then responding to its mechanical state.},

However, it is unclear whether gasdermin-mediated pyroptosis participates in the pathogenesis of CD. Here, we show that the pyroptosis-inducing fragment GSDME N-terminal is obviously detected in the inflamed colonic mucosa but not in the uninflamed mucosa of patients with CD, suggesting that GSDME-mediated pyroptosis may be correlated with intestinal mucosal inflammation in CD. To investigate the role of GSDME in colitis development, Gsdme{\`A}/{\`A} mice and wildtype (WT) littermate controls were treated with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) to induce colitis. We found that Gsdme{\`A}/{\`A} mice exhibit less-severe intestinal inflammation than WT controls do. Furthermore, our results indicate that GSDME-mediated epithelial-cell pyroptosis induces intestinal inflammation through the release of proinflammatory intracellular contents. In summary, we show that GSDME participates in the pathogenesis of CD through GSDME-mediated pyroptosis to release proinflammatory cytokines.},

  abstract = {In recent years, cancer immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has achieved considerable success in the clinic. However, ICIs are significantly limited by the fact that only one third of patients with most types of cancer respond to these agents. The induction of cell death mechanisms other than apoptosis has gradually emerged as a new cancer treatment strategy because most tumors harbor innate resistance to apoptosis. However, to date, the possibility of combining these two modalities has not been discussed systematically. Recently, a few studies revealed crosstalk between distinct cell death mechanisms and antitumor immunity. The induction of pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and necroptosis combined with ICIs showed synergistically enhanced antitumor activity, even in ICI-resistant tumors. Immunotherapy-activated CD8+ T cells are traditionally believed to induce tumor cell death via the following two main pathways: (i) perforin-granzyme and (ii) Fas-FasL. However, recent studies identified a new mechanism by which CD8+ T cells suppress tumor growth by inducing ferroptosis and pyroptosis, which provoked a review of the relationship between tumor cell death mechanisms and immune system activation. Hence, in this review, we summarize knowledge of the reciprocal interaction between antitumor immunity and distinct cell death mechanisms, particularly necroptosis, ferroptosis, and pyroptosis, which are the three potentially novel mechanisms of immunogenic cell death. Because most evidence is derived from studies using animal and cell models, we also reviewed related bioinformatics data available for human tissues in public databases, which partially confirmed the presence of interactions between tumor cell death and the activation of antitumor immunity.},

Moreover, 8-19\% of the genes with multiple known transcript isoforms expressed at least two isoforms in the same blastomere or oocyte, which unambiguously demonstrated the complexity of the transcript variants at whole-genome scale in individual cells.

  abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cancer in women and the third most common in men globally. CRC arises from one or a combination of chromosomal instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, and microsatellite instability. Genetic instability is usually caused by aneuploidy and loss of heterozygosity. Mutations in the tumor suppressor or cell cycle genes may also lead to cellular transformation. Similarly, epigenetic and/or genetic alterations resulting in impaired cellular pathways, such as DNA repair mechanism, may lead to microsatellite instability and mutator phenotype. Non-coding RNAs, more importantly microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs have also been implicated at various CRC stages. Understanding the specific mechanisms of tumorigenesis and the underlying genetic and epigenetic traits is critical in comprehending the disease phenotype. This paper reviews these mechanisms along with the roles of various non-coding RNAs in CRCs.},

The Galaxy reproducible bioinformatics framework provides tools, workflows, and trainings that not only enable users to perform 1-click 10x preprocessing but also empower them to demultiplex raw sequencing from custom tagged and full-length sequencing protocols. The downstream analysis supports a range of high-quality interoperable suites separated into common stages of analysis: inspection, filtering, normalization, confounder removal, and clustering. The teaching resources cover concepts from computer science to cell biology. Access to all resources is provided at the singlecell.usegalaxy.eu portal.The reproducible and training-oriented Galaxy framework provides a sustainable high-performance computing environment for users to run flexible analyses on both 10x and alternative platforms.

We created an Alpi-IRES-CreERT2 (AlpiCreER) knockin allele for lineage tracing. Marked clones consist entirely of enterocytes and are all lost from villus tips within days. Genetic fate-mapping of Alpi+ cells before or during targeted ablation of Lgr5-expressing stem cells generated numerous long-lived crypt-villus ``ribbons,'' indicative of dedifferentiation of enterocyte precursors into Lgr5+ stems. By single-cell analysis of dedifferentiating enterocytes, we observed the generation of Paneth-like cells and proliferative stem cells. We conclude that the highly proliferative, short-lived enterocyte precursors serve as a large reservoir of potential stem cells during crypt regeneration.},

It is acknowledged that miR663a and its targets are inflammation-related genes frequently deregulated in many cancers. The associations between MALAT1 and miR663a and their target genes remain unknown. In this study, it was found that in colon cancer (CC) cells, MALAT1 and miR663a were reciprocally repressed in cDNA array screening and qRT-PCR analysis. However, MALAT1 was significantly upregulated in CC tissues, and miR663a was significantly downregulated relative to the corresponding surgical margin (SM) tissues. An inverse relationship between MALAT1 and miR663a expression was detected among CC tissue samples (n\,=\,172, r\,=\,-0.333, p\,\&lt;\,0.0001). The RNA-pulldown results showed MALAT1 lncRNA{\textendash}miR663a binding. The results of luciferase-reporter analysis further revealed that the MALAT1 7038{\textendash}7059\,nt fragment was the miR663a seed sequence. Both miR663a knockdown and MALAT1 activation alone significantly upregulated the expression levels of miR663a targets, including TGFB1, PIK3CD, P53, P21, and JUND, in the CC cell lines HCT116 and SW480. A positive relationship was also observed between the expression levels of MALAT1 and these miR663a targets in the above 172 CC samples and 160 CC samples in publicly available databases. In addition, reciprocal abolishment of the effects of miR663a overexpression and MALAT1 activation on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells was also observed, while miR663a upregulation and MALAT1 activation alone inhibited and promoted the behaviors of these CC cell lines, respectively. All these suggested that, as a competing endogenous lncRNA, MALAT1 maybe a dominant protector for the degradation of miR663a targets. miR663a and MALAT1 may consist of a negative feedback loop to determine their roles in CC development.},

In the absence of Notch signaling, stem cells preferentially generate secretory cells at the expense of absorptive cells. Here, we use function-blocking antibodies against Notch receptors to demonstrate that Notch blockade perturbs intestinal stem cell function by causing a derepression of the Wnt signaling pathway, leading to misexpression of prosecretory genes. Importantly, attenuation of the Wnt pathway rescued the phenotype associated with Notch blockade. These studies bring to light a~negative regulatory mechanism that maintains stem~cell activity and balanced differentiation, and we propose that the interaction between Wnt and Notch~signaling described here represents a common theme in adult stem cell biology.},

  abstract = {The small intestine epithelium renews every 2 to 5 days, making it one of the most regenerative mammalian tissues. Genetic inducible fate mapping studies have identified two principal epithelial stem cell pools in this tissue. One pool consists of columnar Lgr5-expressing cells that cycle rapidly and are present predominantly at the crypt base. The other pool consists of Bmi1-expressing cells that largely reside above the crypt base. However, the relative functions of these two pools and their interrelationship are not understood. Here, we specifically ablated Lgr5-expressing cells using a diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) gene knocked into the Lgr5 locus. We found that complete loss of the Lgr5-expressing cells did not perturb homeostasis of the epithelium, indicating that other cell types can compensate for elimination of this population. After ablation of Lgr5-expressing cells, progeny production by Bmi1-expressing cells increased, suggesting that Bmi1-expressing stem cells compensate for the loss of Lgr5-expressing cells. Indeed, lineage tracing showed that Bmi1-expressing cells gave rise to Lgr5-expressing cells, pointing to a hierarchy of stem cells in the intestinal epithelium. Our results demonstrate that Lgr5-expressing cells are dispensable for normal intestinal homeostasis. In the absence of these cells, the Bmi1-expressing cells can serve as an alternative stem cell pool, providing the first experimental evidence for the interrelationship between these populations. The Bmi1-expressing stem cells may represent both a reserve stem cell pool in case of injury to the small intestine epithelium and a source for replenishment of the Lgr5-expressing cells under non-pathological conditions.},

  abstract = {Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk of 10\%-15\% developing colorectal cancer (CRC) that is a common disease of high economic costs in developed countries. The CRC has been increasing in recent years and its mortality rates are very high. Multiple biological and biochemical factors are responsible for the onset and progression of this pathology. Moreover, it appears absolutely necessary to investigate the environmental factors favoring the onset of CRC and the promotion of colonic health. The gut microflora, or microbiota, has an extensive diversity both quantitatively and qualitatively. In utero, the intestine of the mammalian fetus is sterile. At birth, the intestinal microbiota is acquired by ingesting maternal anal or vaginal organisms, ultimately developing into a stable community, with marked variations in microbial composition between individuals. The development of IBD is often associated with qualitative and quantitative disorders of the intestinal microbial flora (dysbiosis). The healthy human gut harbours about 10 different bacterial species distributed in colony forming units which colonize the gastrointestinal tract. The intestinal microbiota plays a fundamental role in health and in the progression of diseases such as IBD and CRC. In healthy subjects, the main control of intestinal bacterial colonization occurs through gastric acidity but other factors such as endoluminal temperature, competition between different bacterial strains, peristalsis and drugs can influence the intestinal microenvironment. The microbiota exerts diverse physiological functions to include: growth inhibition of pathogenic microorganisms, synthesis of compounds useful for the trophism of colonic mucosa, regulation of intestinal lymphoid tissue and synthesis of amino acids. Furthermore, mucus seems to play an important role in protecting the intestinal mucosa and maintaining its integrity. Changes in the microbiota composition are mainly influenced by diet and age, as well as genetic factors. Increasing evidence indicates that dysbiosis favors the production of genotoxins and metabolites associated with carcinogenesis and induces dysregulation of the immune response which promotes and sustains inflammation in IBD leading to carcinogenesis. A disequilibrium in gut microflora composition leads to the specific activation of gut associated lymphoid tissue. The associated chronic inflammatory process associated increases the risk of developing CRC. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the two major IBDs characterized by an early onset and extraintestinal manifestations, such as rheumatoid arthritis. The pathogenesis of both diseases is complex and not yet fully known. However, it is widely accepted that an inappropriate immune response to microbial flora can play a pivotal role in IBD pathogenesis.},

However, the mechanism of, and requirement for, progenitor plasticity in mediating pathological response remain unknown. Here we show that phosphorylation of the transcription factor Atoh1 is required for both the contribution of secretory progenitors to the stem cell pool and for a robust regenerative response. As confirmed by lineage tracing, Atoh1+ cells (Atoh1(WT)CreERT2 mice) give rise to multilineage intestinal clones both in the steady state and~after tissue damage. In a phosphomutant Atoh1(9S/T-A)CreERT2 line, preventing phosphorylation of ATOH1 protein acts to promote secretory differentiation and inhibit the contribution of progenitors to self-renewal. Following chemical colitis, Atoh1+ cells of Atoh1(9S/T-A)CreERT2 mice have reduced clonogenicity that affects overall regeneration. Progenitor plasticity maintains robust self-renewal in the intestinal epithelium, and the balance between stem and progenitor fate is directly coordinated by ATOH1 multisite phosphorylation.},

  abstract = {A novel Ebola virus (EBOV) first identified in March 2014 has infected more than 25,000 people in West Africa, resulting in more than 10,000 deaths. Preliminary analyses of genome sequences of 81 EBOV collected from March to June 2014 from Guinea and Sierra Leone suggest that the 2014 EBOV originated from an independent transmission event from its natural reservoir followed by sustained human-to-human infections. It has been reported that the EBOV genome variation might have an effect on the efficacy of sequence-based virus detection and candidate therapeutics. However, only limited viral information has been available since July 2014, when the outbreak entered a rapid growth phase. Here we describe 175 full-length EBOV genome sequences from five severely stricken districts in Sierra Leone from 28 September to 11 November 2014. We found that the 2014 EBOV has become more phylogenetically and genetically diverse from July to November 2014, characterized by the emergence of multiple novel lineages. The substitution rate for the 2014 EBOV was estimated to be 1.23 {\texttimes} 10(-3) substitutions per site per year (95\% highest posterior density interval, 1.04 {\texttimes} 10(-3) to 1.41 {\texttimes} 10(-3) substitutions per site per year), approximating to that observed between previous EBOV outbreaks. The sharp increase in genetic diversity of the 2014 EBOV warrants extensive EBOV surveillance in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia to better understand the viral evolution and transmission dynamics of the ongoing outbreak. These data will facilitate the international efforts to develop vaccines and therapeutics.},

  abstract = {Background Validation and standardization of methodologies for microbial community measurements by high-throughput sequencing are needed to support human microbiome research and its industrialization. This study set out to establish standards-based solutions to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of metagenomics-based microbiome profiling of human fecal samples. Results In the first phase, we performed a head-to-head comparison of a wide range of protocols for DNA extraction and sequencing library construction using defined mock communities, to identify performant protocols and pinpoint sources of inaccuracy in quantification. In the second phase, we validated performant protocols with respect to their variability of measurement results within a single laboratory (that is, intermediate precision) as well as interlaboratory transferability and reproducibility through an industry-based collaborative study. We further ascertained the performance of our recommended protocols in the context of a community-wide interlaboratory study (that is, the MOSAIC Standards Challenge). Finally, we defined performance metrics to provide best practice guidance for improving measurement consistency across methods and laboratories. Conclusions The validated protocols and methodological guidance for DNA extraction and library construction provided in this study expand current best practices for metagenomic analyses of human fecal microbiota. Uptake of our protocols and guidelines will improve the accuracy and comparability of metagenomics-based studies of the human microbiome, thereby facilitating development and commercialization of human microbiome-based products.,  Video Abstract Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40168-021-01048-3.},

  abstract = {Background The rapidly evolving 2014 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa is the largest documented in history, both in terms of the number of people infected and in the geographic spread. The high morbidity and mortality have inspired response strategies to the outbreak at the individual, regional, and national levels. Methods to provide real-time assessment of changing transmission dynamics are critical to the understanding of how these adaptive intervention measures have affected the spread of the outbreak. Methods In this analysis, we use the time series of EVD cases in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia up to September 8, 2014, and employ novel methodology to estimate how the rate of exponential rise of new cases has changed over the outbreak using piecewise fits of exponential curves to the outbreak data. Results We find that for Liberia and Guinea, the effective reproduction number rose, rather than fell, around the time that the outbreak spread to densely populated cities, and enforced quarantine was imposed on several regions in the countries; this may indicate that enforced quarantine may not be an effective control measure. Conclusions If effective control measures are not put in place, and the current rate of exponential rise of new cases continues, we predict 4400 new Ebola cases in West Africa during the last half of the month of September, with an upper 95\% confidence level of 6800 new cases.},

Time-series gene expression analyses of bulk cells have difficulty distinguishing early and late phases of a transcriptional cascade or identifying rare subpopulations of cells, and single-cell proteomic methods rely on a priori knowledge of key distinguishing markers. Here we describe Monocle, an unsupervised algorithm that increases the temporal resolution of transcriptome dynamics using single-cell RNA-Seq data collected at multiple time points. Applied to the differentiation of primary human myoblasts, Monocle revealed switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors, sequential waves of gene regulation, and expression of regulators that were not known to act in differentiation. We validated some of these predicted regulators in a loss-of function screen. Monocle can in principle be used to recover single-cell gene expression kinetics from a wide array of cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation and oncogenic transformation.},

  abstract = {Single cell genomics has become a popular approach to uncover the cellular heterogeneity of progenitor and terminally differentiated cell types with great precision. This approach can also delineate lineage hierarchies and identify molecular programmes of cell-fate acquisition and segregation. Nowadays, tens of thousands of cells are routinely sequenced in single cell-based methods and even more are expected to be analysed in the future. However, interpretation of the resulting data is challenging and requires computational models at multiple levels of abstraction. In contrast to other applications of single cell sequencing, where clustering approaches dominate, developmental systems are generally modelled using continuous structures, trajectories and trees. These trajectory models carry the promise of elucidating mechanisms of development, disease and stimulation response at very high molecular resolution. However, their reliable analysis and biological interpretation requires an understanding of their underlying assumptions and limitations. Here, we review the basic concepts of such computational approaches and discuss the characteristics of developmental processes that can be learnt from trajectory models.},

  abstract = {Objective Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) at the internal/external interface orchestrate the mucosal immune response. Paneth cells secrete antimicrobial peptides and inflammatory mediators, protect from pathogens and shape the commensal microbiota. Prompted by the genetic association of the locus harbouring the type I interferon (IFN) receptor (IFNAR1) with Crohn's disease, and a transcriptional signature for type I IFN signalling in Paneth cells, we studied the function of IFNAR1 in IECs. Design Type I IFN signalling was studied in mice with conditional deletion of Ifnar1 in IECs. Phenotype was characterised at baseline, and gut microbiota composition was assessed by 16S rDNA ribotyping. The role of IFNAR1 was also investigated in experimental colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) and colitis-associated cancer induced by DSS in conjunction with azoxymethane (AOM). Results Ifnar1-/-(IEC) mice displayed expansion of Paneth cell numbers and epithelial hyperproliferation compared with Ifnar1-sufficient littermates. While Ifnar1-/-(IEC) mice did not exhibit spontaneous inflammation or increased severity in DSS colitis compared with Ifnar1+/+(IEC) mice, they exhibited an increased tumour burden in the AOM/DSS model. Both hyperproliferation and tumour promotion were dependent on the microbial flora, as the differences between genotypes were marked upon separately housing mice, but disappeared when Ifnar1-/-(IEC) and Ifnar1+/+(IEC) mice were co-housed. Accordingly, ribotyping revealed marked differences between Ifnar1-/-(IEC) and Ifnar1+/+(IEC) mice that where diminished upon co-housing. Conclusions IFNAR1 in IECs, and Paneth cells in particular, contributes to the regulation of the host{\textendash}microbiota relationship, with consequences for intestinal regeneration and colitis-associated tumour formation.},

  abstract = {The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) reflects a balance between mucosal injury and reparative mechanisms. Some regenerating gene (Reg) family members have been reported to be expressed in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) and to be involved as proliferative mucosal factors in IBD. However, expression of all REG family genes in IBD is still unclear. Here, we analyzed expression of all REG family genes (REG I{$\alpha$}, REG I{$\beta$}, REG III, HIP/PAP, and REG IV) in biopsy specimens of UC and CD by real-time RT-PCR. REG I{$\alpha$}, REG I{$\beta$}, and REG IV genes were overexpressed in CD samples. REG IV gene was also overexpressed in UC samples. We further analyzed the expression mechanisms of REG I{$\alpha$}, REG I{$\beta$}, and REG IV genes in human colon cells. The expression of REG I{$\alpha$} was significantly induced by IL-6 or IL-22, and REG I{$\beta$} was induced by IL-22. Deletion analyses revealed that three regions (- 220 to - 211, - 179 to - 156, and - 146 to - 130) in REG I{$\alpha$} and the region (- 274 to- 260) in REG I{$\beta$} promoter were responsible for the activation by IL-22/IL-6. The promoters contain consensus transcription factor binding sequences for MZF1, RTEF1/TEAD4, and STAT3 in REG I{$\alpha$}, and HLTF/FOXN2F in REG I{$\beta$}, respectively. The introduction of siRNAs for MZF1, RTEF1/TEAD4, STAT3, and HLTF/FOXN2F abolished the transcription of REG I{$\alpha$} and REG I{$\beta$}.

We focused on three scenarios: (i) travel from Beni airport, (ii) travel from Beni, Goma and Bunia airports and (iii) travel from Beni, Goma and Bunia, and Kigali airports. We evaluated country-level Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI) scores for traveller destinations.There were 2255 commercial air passengers departing from Beni Airport during the specified time frame, all with domestic destinations, and 55\% of which were to Goma. A total of 29 777 passengers travelled from Beni, Bunia and Goma airports during this time frame, with most travel (94.6\%) departing from Goma Airport. A total of 72.4\% of passengers' final destination from these three airports were within the DRC, primarily to Kinshasa. There were 166 281 outbound passengers from Beni, Bunia, Goma and Kigali airports with the majority (82.1\%) of passengers departing from Kigali. The most frequent destinations from these airports were Nairobi, Kinshasa and Entebbe. Eight of the 10 destinations with greatest passenger volumes are to countries with IDVI scores less than 0.4.There is little commercial airline connectivity from the current EVD-affected area; however, larger cities in DRC and throughout East Africa should be aware of the low potential for EVD importation through this route. Most countries at greatest risk for EVD importation have limited capacity to manage these cases.},

In order to investigate the impact of nutrient limitation on the N2-fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs) in the TNAtl, trace metal clean nutrient amendment experiments were conducted, and the expression of nitrogenase (nifH) in cyanobacterial diazotrophs in response to the addition of Fe, P, or Fe+P was measured using quantitative PCR. To provide context, N2 fixation rates associated with the {$<$}10 {$\mu$}m community and diel nifH expression in natural cyanobacterial populations were measured. In the western TNAtl, nifH expression in Crocosphaera, Trichodesmium, and Richelia was stimulated by Fe and Fe+P additions, but not by P, implying that diazotrophs may be Fe-limited in this region. In the eastern TNAtl, nifH expression in unicellular cyanobacteria UCYN-A and Crocosphaera was stimulated by P, implying P-limitation. In equatorial waters, nifH expression in Trichodesmium was highest in Fe+P treatments, implying co-limitation in this region. Nutrient additions did not measurably stimulate N2 fixation rates in the {$<$}10 {$\mu$}m fraction in most of the experiments, even when upregulation of nifH expression was evident. These results demonstrate the utility of using gene expression to investigate the physiological state of natural populations of microorganisms, while underscoring the complexity of nutrient limitation on diazotrophy, and providing evidence that diazotroph populations are slow to respond to the addition of limiting nutrients and may be limited by different nutrients on basin-wide spatial scales. This has important implications for our current understanding of controls on N2 fixation in the TNAtl and may partially explain why it appears to be intermittently limited by Fe, P, or both.},

Yet external benchmarking of this technologies' capabilities has not been extensively reported, nor has thorough evaluation of its utility for field-based analysis with sub-optimal sample types been described. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of the MinION sequencer for bacterial genomic and metagenomic applications, with specific emphasis placed on the quality, yield, and accuracy of generated sequence data. Two independent laboratories at the National Microbiology Laboratory (Public Health Agency of Canada), sequenced a set of microbes in replicate, using the currently available flowcells, sequencing chemistries, and software available at the time of the experiment. Overall sequencing yield and quality improved through the course of this set of experiments. Sequencing alignment accuracy was high reaching 97\% for all 2D experiments, though was slightly lower for 1D sequencing (94\%). 1D sequencing provided much longer sequences than 2D. Both sequencing chemistries performed equally well in constructing genomic assemblies. There was evidence of barcode cross-over using both the native and PCR barcoding methods. Despite the sub-optimal nature of samples sequenced in the field, sequences attributable to B. anthracis the target organism used in this scenario, could none-the-less be detected. Together, this report showcases the rapid advancement in this technology and its utility in the context of genomic sequencing of microbial isolates of importance to public health.},

GWAS results have a range of applications, such as gaining insight into a phenotype's underlying biology, estimating its heritability, calculating genetic correlations, making clinical risk predictions, informing drug development programmes and inferring potential causal relationships between risk factors and health outcomes. In this Primer, we provide the reader with an introduction to GWAS, explaining their statistical basis and how they are conducted, describe state-of-the art approaches and discuss limitations and challenges, concluding with an overview of the current and future applications for GWAS results.},

It began following the cross-species transmission of EBOV from an animal reservoir, most likely bats, into humans, with phylogenetic analysis revealing the co-circulation of several viral lineages. We hypothesized that this prolonged human circulation led to genomic changes that increased viral transmissibility in humans. We generated a synthetic glycoprotein (GP) construct based on the earliest reported isolate and introduced amino acid substitutions that defined viral lineages. Mutant GPs were used to generate a panel of pseudoviruses, which were used to infect different human and bat cell lines. These data revealed that specific amino acid substitutions in the EBOV GP have increased tropism for human cells, while reducing tropism for bat cells. Such increased infectivity may have enhanced the ability of EBOV to transmit among humans and contributed to the wide geographic distribution of some viral lineages.},

Its manifestation implicates NF-kappaB and AP-1 signaling pathways by virtue of their regulative role on the genetic control of cell cycle and apoptosis as well as by their capacity to be constitutively activated or exogenously induced by growth factors, cytokines, stress signals and oncoproteins. In CRC, the positive impact of NF-kappaB and AP-1 on the transcription of angiogenic and invasive factors strongly implicates these transcription factors in the transition of benign carcinomas towards a metastatic phenotype. Furthermore, the deregulated function of NF-kappaB and AP-1 in CRC cells affects inflammatory cascades, manifested by the ample production of inflammatory mediators. In this perspective, inhibition of NF-kappaB and AP-1 signaling mechanisms has become a rational target in the development of novel therapeutic approaches against CRC.},

This high cell turnover makes it a very attractive and comprehensive adult organ system for the study of cell proliferation and differentiation. The intestine is composed of proliferative crypts, which contain intestinal stem cells, and villi, which contain differentiated specialized cell types. Through the recent identification of Lgr5, an intestinal stem cell marker, it is now possible to visualize stem cells and study their behavior and differentiation in a much broader context. In this review we describe the identification of intestinal stem cells. We also discuss genetic studies that have helped to elucidate those signals important for progenitor cells to differentiate into one of the specialized intestinal epithelial cell types. These studies describe a genetic hierarchy responsible for cell fate commitment in normal gut physiology. Where relevant we also mention aberrant deregulation of these molecular pathways that results in colon cancer.},

We reasoned that in intestinal inflammation the initial activation of the innate immune response fails to resolve, finally resulting in uncontrolled chronic inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: To identify the early inflammatory events in colitis that remain active in human chronic colitis, we analyzed the changes of the colonic transcriptome during acute experimental colitis and compared the outcome with previously published profiles of affected tissues from patients with UC and CD, and as a control for intestinal inflammation in general, tissues from celiac disease patients. Rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissues were included as a nonintestinal inflammatory disease. The expression profiles of each disease were analyzed separately, in which diseased tissues were compared to unaffected tissues from the same anatomical location. RESULTS: Gene ontology analysis of significantly regulated genes revealed a marked activation of immunity and defense processes in all diseases, except celiac disease, where immune activation is less prominent. The control region of upregulated genes contained an increase in Ets2 binding sites in experimental colitis, UC, and rheumatoid arthritis, and were associated with upregulated immune activity. In contrast, upregulated genes in celiac disease harbored the transcription factor binding site GLI, which binds to the Gli family of transcription factors involved in hedgehog signaling, affecting development and morphogenesis. CONCLUSION: Ets2 may be an important transcription factor driving inflammation in acute as well as chronic inflammatory disease},

We show that disruption of beta-catenin/TCF-4 activity in CRC cells induces a rapid G1 arrest and blocks a genetic program that is physiologically active in the proliferative compartment of colon crypts. Coincidently, an intestinal differentiation program is induced. The TCF-4 target gene c-MYC plays a central role in this switch by direct repression of the p21(CIP1/WAF1) promoter. Following disruption of beta-catenin/TCF-4 activity, the decreased expression of c-MYC releases p21(CIP1/WAF1) transcription, which in turn mediates G1 arrest and differentiation. Thus, the beta-catenin/TCF-4 complex constitutes the master switch that controls proliferation versus differentiation in healthy and malignant intestinal epithelial cells.},

METHODS Choosing a panel of cytokines crucial for Th17/Treg differentiation and behavior, in colon specimens, as mRNA biomarkers, and their serum protein levels. RESULTS We found a significant difference between higher gene expression of FoxP3, TGFb1, IL-10, and IL-23, and approximately equal level of IL-6 in CRC patients in comparison with IBD patients. After stratification of CRC patients, we found a significant difference in FoxP3, IL-10, IL-23, and IL-17A mRNA in early cases compared to IBD, and IL-23 alone in advanced CRC. The protein levels of the cytokines were significantly higher in CRC patients compared to IBD patients. CONCLUSION Our findings showed that IL-6 upregulation is essential for both IBD and CRC development until the upregulation of other Th17/Treg related genes (TGFb1, IL-10, IL-23, and transcription factor FoxP3) is a crucial primarily for CRC development. The significantly upregulated IL-6 could be a potential drug target for IBD and prevention of CRC development as well.},

  abstract = {Neutrophil dysfunction and GM-CSF auto-antibodies are observed in pediatric and adult patients with Crohn's disease (CD). We associated damaging coding variants with low GM-CSF induced STAT5 stimulation index (GMSI) in pediatric CD patients and implicated variation of neutrophil GM-CSF signaling in cell function and disease complications. Because many CD patients with low GMSI do not carry damaging coding mutations, we sought to test the hypothesis that non-coding variants contribute to this phenotype. We enrolled, performed whole genome sequencing, and measured the GMSI in 77 CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients (24 low and 53 normal GMSI). We identified 4 non-coding variants (rs3808851, rs10974787, rs10974788 and rs10974789) in RCL1 significantly associated with variation of GMSI level (p\,{$<$}\,0.011). They were validated in two independent cohorts with: RNAseq data (n\,=\,50) and blood eQTL dataset (n\,=\,31,684). These variants are in LD and affect expression of JAK2 (p 0.005 to 0.013), RCL1 (p 8.17E-13 to 2.98E-11) and AK3 (p 2.00E-68 to 3.03E-55) genes. Additionally, they influence proteins involved in differentiation of gut epithelium, inflammation, and immune system regulation. In summary, our study outlines the contribution of non-coding variants in neutrophil GM-CSF signaling and the potential importance of RCL1 and AK3 in CD pathogenesis.},

There is a lack of evidence to demonstrate that esophageal progenitors can be the source of columnar metaplasia. In this study, using transgenic mouse models, lineage tracing, single-cell RNA sequencing, and transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling, we found that the activation of the Hedgehog pathway in esophageal cells modifies their differentiation status in~vivo. This process involves an initial step of dedifferentiation into embryonic-like esophageal progenitors. Moreover, a subset of these cells undergoes full squamous-to-columnar conversion and expresses selected intestinal markers. These modifications of cell fate are associated with remodeling of the chromatin and the appearance of Sox9. Using a conditional knockout mouse, we show that Sox9 is required for columnar conversion but not for the step of dedifferentiation. These results provide insight into the mechanisms by which esophageal cells might initiate columnar metaplasia.},

  abstract = {Almost all currently available treatments for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) act by inhibiting inflammation, often blocking specific inflammatory molecules. However, given the infectious and neoplastic disease burden associated with chronic immunosuppressive therapy, the goal of attaining mucosal healing without immunosuppression is attractive. The absence of treatments that directly promote mucosal healing and regeneration in IBD could be linked to the lack of understanding of the underlying pathways. The range of potential strategies to achieve mucosal healing is diverse. However, the targeting of regenerative mechanisms has not yet been achieved for IBD. Stem cells provide hope as a regenerative treatment and are used in limited clinical situations. Growth factors are available for the treatment of short bowel syndrome but have not yet been applied in IBD. The therapeutic application of organoid culture and stem cell therapy to generate new intestinal tissue could provide a novel mechanism to restore barrier function in IBD. Furthermore, blocking key effectors of barrier dysfunction (such as MLCK or damage-associated molecular pattern molecules) has shown promise in experimental IBD. Here, we review the diversity of molecular targets available to directly promote mucosal healing, experimental models to identify new potential pathways and some of the anticipated potential therapies for IBD.},

We compared the accuracy, continuity, and gene annotation of genome assemblies generated from either high-fidelity (HiFi) or continuous long-read (CLR) datasets from the same complete hydatidiform mole human genome. We find that the HiFi sequence data assemble an additional 10\% of duplicated regions and more accurately represent the structure of tandem repeats, as validated with orthogonal analyses. As a result, an additional 5 Mbp of pericentromeric sequences are recovered in the HiFi assembly, resulting in a 2.5-fold increase in the NG50 within 1 Mbp of the centromere (HiFi 480.6 kbp, CLR 191.5 kbp). Additionally, the HiFi genome assembly was generated in significantly less time with fewer computational resources than the CLR assembly. Although the HiFi assembly has significantly improved continuity and accuracy in many complex regions of the genome, it still falls short of the assembly of centromeric DNA and the largest regions of segmental duplication using existing assemblers. Despite these shortcomings, our results suggest that HiFi may be the most effective standalone technology for de novo assembly of human genomes.},

  abstract = {Background: The Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic in Western Africa is the largest in recorded history and control efforts have so far failed to stem the rapid growth in the number of infections. Mathematical models serve a key role in estimating epidemic growth rates and the reproduction number (R0) from surveillance data and, recently, molecular sequence data. Phylodynamic analysis of existing EBOV time-stamped sequence data may provide independent estimates of the unobserved number of infections, reveal recent epidemiological history, and provide insight into selective pressures acting upon viral genes. Methods: We fit a series mathematical models of infectious disease dynamics to phylogenies estimated from 78 whole EBOV genomes collected from distinct patients in May and June of 2014 in Sierra Leone, and perform evolutionary analysis on these genomes combined with closely related EBOV genomes from previous outbreaks. Two analyses are conducted with values of the latent period that have been used in recent modelling efforts. We also examined the EBOV sequences for evidence of possible episodic adaptive molecular evolution during the 2014 outbreak. Results: We find evidence for adaptive evolution affecting L and GP protein coding regions of the EBOV genome, which is unlikely to bias molecular clock and phylodynamic analyses. We estimate R0=2.40 (95\% HPD:1.54-3.87 ) if the mean latent period is 5.3 days, and R0=3.81, (95\% HPD:2.47-6.3) if the mean latent period is 12.7 days. The estimated coefficient of variation (CV) of the number of transmissions per infected host is very high, and a large proportion of infections yield no transmissions. Conclusions: Estimates of R0 are sensitive to the unknown latent infectious period which can not be reliably estimated from genetic data alone. EBOV phylogenies show significant evidence for superspreading and extreme variance in the number of transmissions per infected individual during the early epidemic in Sierra Leone.},

Many large datasets of fast-evolving viruses are not well fitted by molecular clock models that assume a constant substitution rate through time, and more flexible relaxed clock models are required for robust inference of rates and dates. Estimation of relaxed molecular clocks using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo is computationally expensive and may not scale well to large datasets. We build on recent advances in maximum likelihood and least-squares phylogenetic and molecular clock dating methods to develop a fast relaxed-clock method based on a Gamma-Poisson mixture model of substitution rates. This method estimates a distinct substitution rate for every lineage in the phylogeny while being scalable to large phylogenies. Unknown lineage sample dates can be estimated as well as unknown root position. We estimate confidence intervals for rates, dates, and tip dates using parametric and non-parametric bootstrap approaches. This method is implemented as an open-source R package, treedater.},

  abstract = {Viral phylodynamics is defined as the study of how epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes act and potentially interact to shape viral phylogenies. Since the coining of the term in 2004, research on viral phylodynamics has focused on transmission dynamics in an effort to shed light on how these dynamics impact viral genetic variation. Transmission dynamics can be considered at the level of cells within an infected host, individual hosts within a population, or entire populations of hosts. Many viruses, especially RNA viruses, rapidly accumulate genetic variation because of short generation times and high mutation rates. Patterns of viral genetic variation are therefore heavily influenced by how quickly transmission occurs and by which entities transmit to one another. Patterns of viral genetic variation will also be affected by selection acting on viral phenotypes. Although viruses can differ with respect to many phenotypes, phylodynamic studies have to date tended to focus on a limited number of viral phenotypes. These include virulence phenotypes, phenotypes associated with viral transmissibility, cell or tissue tropism phenotypes, and antigenic phenotypes that can facilitate escape from host immunity. Due to the impact that transmission dynamics and selection can have on viral genetic variation, viral phylogenies can therefore be used to investigate important epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes, such as epidemic spread [2], spatio-temporal dynamics including metapopulation dynamics [3], zoonotic transmission, tissue tropism [4], and antigenic drift [5]. The quantitative investigation of these processes through the consideration of viral phylogenies is the central aim of viral phylodynamics.},

In colorectal cancer (CRC), EMT is associated with an invasive or metastatic phenotype. In this review, we discuss recent studies exploring novel regulation mechanisms of EMT in CRC, including the identification of new CRC EMT regulators. Upregulation of inducers can promote EMT, leading to increased invasiveness and metastasis in CRC. These inducers can downregulate E-cadherin and upregulate N-cadherin and vimentin (VIM) through modulating EMT-related signaling pathways, for instance WNT/{$\beta$}-catenin and TGF-{$\beta$}, and EMT transcription factors, such as zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) and ZEB2. In addition, several microRNAs (miRNAs), including members of the miR-34 and miR-200 families, are found to target mRNAs of EMT-transcription factors, for example ZEB1, ZEB2, or SNAIL. Downregulation of these miRNAs is associated with distant metastasis and advanced stage tumors. Furthermore, the role of EMT in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is also discussed. Mesenchymal markers on the surface of EMT CTCs were found to be associated with metastasis and could serve as potential biomarkers for metastasis. Altogether, these studies indicate that EMT is orchestrated by a complicated network, involving regulators of different signaling pathways. Further studies are required to understand the mechanisms underlying EMT in CRC.},

PATMAT can use protein or (translated) DNA sequences, patterns or blocks of aligned proteins as queries of databases consisting of amino acid or nucleotide sequences, patterns or blocks. The ability to search databases of blocks by 'on-the-fly' conversion to scoring matrices provides a new tool for detection and evaluation of distant relationships. PATMAT uses a pull-down, menu-driven interface to carry out its multiple searching, extraction and viewing functions. Each query or database type is recognized, reported, and the appropriate search carried out, with matches and alignments reported in windows as they occur. Any of the high scoring matches can be exported to a file, viewed and recalled as a query using only a few keystrokes or mouse selections. Searches of multiple database files are carried out by user selection within a window. PATMAT runs under DOS; the searching engine also runs under UNIX.},

CD44 is such a positive regulator and a Wnt target gene. While highly expressed in intestinal crypts and used as a stem cell marker, its role during intestinal homeostasis and regeneration remains unknown. Here we propose a CD44 positive-feedback loop that boosts Wnt signal transduction, thus impacting intestinal regeneration. Excision of Cd44 in Cd44fl/fl;VillinCreERT2 mice reduced Wnt target gene expression in intestinal crypts and affected stem cell functionality in organoids. Although the integrity of the intestinal epithelium was conserved in mice lacking CD44, they were hypersensitive to dextran sulfate sodium, and showed more severe inflammation and delayed regeneration. We localized the molecular function of CD44 at the Wnt signalosome, and identified novel DVL/CD44 and AXIN/CD44 complexes. CD44 thus promotes optimal Wnt signaling during intestinal regeneration.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: American and European guidelines propose complete endoscopic resection of polypoid dysplasia (adenomas or adenoma-like masses) in patients with longstanding colitis, with close endoscopic follow-up. The incidence of cancer after detection of flat low-grade dysplasia or dysplasia-associated lesion or mass is estimated at 14 cases/1000 years of patient follow-up. However, the risk for polypoid dysplasia has not been determined with precision. We investigated the risk of cancer after endoscopic resection of polypoid dysplasia in patients with ulcerative colitis. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and the Cochrane library were searched for studies of patients with colitis and resected polypoid dysplasia, with reports of colonoscopic follow-up and data on cancers detected. Outcomes from included articles were pooled to provide a single combined estimate of outcomes by using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Of 425 articles retrieved, we analyzed data from 10 studies, comprising 376 patients with colitis and polypoid dysplasia with a combined 1704 years of follow-up. A mean of 2.8 colonoscopies were performed for each patient after the index procedure (range, 0-15 colonoscopies). The pooled incidence of cancer was 5.3 cases (95\% confidence interval, 2.7-10.1 cases)/1000 years of patient follow-up. There was no evidence of heterogeneity or publication bias. The pooled rate of any dysplasia was 65 cases (95\% confidence interval, 54-78 cases)/1000 patient years. CONCLUSION: Patients with colitis have a low risk of colorectal cancer after resection of polypoid dysplasia; these findings support the current strategy of resection and surveillance. However, these patients have a 10-fold greater risk of developing any dysplasia than colorectal cancer and should undergo close endoscopic follow-up.},

Our previous study found that EVO attenuates colitis by regulating gut microbiota and metabolites. However, little is known about its effect on colitis-associated cancer (CAC). In this study, the protective effects of EVO on azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and tumor mice were observed, and the underlying potential mechanism was clarified. The results suggested that EVO ameliorated AOM/DSS-induced colitis by inhibiting the intestinal inflammation and improving mucosal barrier function. And EVO significantly reduced the number and size of AOM/DSS-induced colorectal tumors along with promoted apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of epithelial cell. Moreover, EVO promoted the enrichment of SCFAs-producing bacteria and reduced the levels of the pro-inflammatory bacteria, which contributes to the changes of microbiota metabolism, especially tryptophan metabolism. Furthermore, inflammatory response (like Wnt signaling pathway、Hippo signaling pathway and IL-17 signaling pathway) were effectively alleviated by EVO. Our study demonstrated that the protective therapeutic action of EVO on CAC is to inhibit the development of intestinal inflammation-cancer by regulating gut microbiota metabolites and signaling pathways of colon intestinal epithelial, which may represent a novel agent for colon cancer prevention via manipulation of gut microbiota.},

As a member of tight junctions (TJs) family, Claudin-7 (Cldn-7) is dedicated to maintaining cell polarity and TJs barrier integrity, and closely related to the development of inflammation and tumors. However, potential roles of Cldn-7 in intestinal inflammation and colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) have not been well characterized in vivo. Here, we analyzed the expression profile of Cldn-7 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and CAC. Colitis and colitis-cancer transformation models were established based on inducible intestinal conditional Cldn-7 gene knockout mice (Cldn7fl/fl;villinCreERT2), by intraperitoneal injection of azomethane (AOM) and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) feeding. Cldn-7 knockout promoted susceptibility to colitis and CAC, aggravated clinical symptoms, severely damaged intestinal epithelium, increased mucosal inflammation accompanied dysregulated cell prolif\- eration-apoptosis. Epithelial barrier integrity was destroyed, and intercellular permeability was increased. After AOM/DSS induction, tumor burden and volume were increased, characterized by enhanced pro\- liferation and activation of Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin signaling pathway. Mechanistically, Cldn-7 deficiency promoted colitis and subsequently malignant transformation by destroying TJs integrity and increasing inflamma\- tory cascade. Overall, based on Cldn-7 knockout mouse model, we have first demonstrated the key roles of Cldn-7 in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and preventing IBD and consequent CAC.},

In comparison to scoring function, the development of gap penalty functions has rarely been addressed in profile{\textendash}profile alignment algorithms. Although indel frequency profiles have been used to construct profile-based variable gap penalties in some profile{\textendash}profile alignment algorithms, there is still no fair comparison between variable gap penalties and traditional linear gap penalties to quantify the improvement of alignment accuracy. We compared two linear gap penalty functions, the traditional affine gap penalty (AGP) and the bilinear gap penalty (BGP), with two profile-based variable gap penalty functions, the Profile-based Gap Penalty used in SP5 (SPGP) and a new Weighted Profile-based Gap Penalty (WPGP) developed by us, on some well-established benchmark datasets. Our results show that profile-based variable gap penalties get limited improvements than linear gap penalties, whether incorporated with secondary structure information or not. Secondary structure information appears less powerful to be incorporated into gap penalties than into scoring functions. Analysis of gap length distributions indicates that gap penalties could stably maintain corresponding distributions of gap lengths in their alignments, but the distribution difference from reference alignments does not reflect the performance of gap penalties. There is useful information in indel frequency profiles, but it is still not good enough for improving alignment accuracy when used in profile-based variable gap penalties.

The regulation of gene transcription involves not only individual transcription factors (TFs) but also transcription complexes (TCs) composed of transcription factor(s) and multisubunit cofactors. In their normal compositions, TCs orchestrate lineage-specific patterns of gene expression and ensure the production of the correct proportions of individual cell lineages during hematopoiesis. The integration of posttranslational and conformational modifications in the chromatin landscape, nucleosomes, histones and interacting components via the cofactor{\textendash}TF interplay is critical to optimal TF activity. Mutations or translocations of cofactor genes are expected to alter cofactor{\textendash}TF interactions, which may be causative for the pathogenesis of various hematologic disorders. Blocking TF oncogenic activity in hematologic disorders through targeting cofactors in aberrant complexes has been an exciting therapeutic strategy. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge regarding the models and functions of cofactor{\textendash}TF interplay in physiological hematopoiesis and highlight their implications in the etiology of hematological malignancies.

Here, we identify a Hopx+ colitis-associated regenerative stem cell (CARSC) population that functionally contributes to mucosal repair in mouse models of colitis. Hopx+ CARSCs, enriched for fetal-like markers, transiently arose from hypertrophic crypts known to facilitate regeneration. Importantly, we established a long-term, self-organizing two-dimensional (2D) epithelial monolayer system to model the regenerative properties and responses of Hopx+ CARSCs. This system can reenact the ``homeostasis-injury-regeneration'' cycles of epithelial alterations that occur in~vivo. Using this system, we found that hypoxia and endoplasmic reticulum stress, insults commonly present in inflammatory bowel diseases, mediated the cyclic switch of cellular status in this process.},

The sequences generated by PacBio or Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) be assembled de novo before further analyses. Some genome de novo assemblers have been developed to assemble long reads generated by ONT. The performance of these assemblers has not been completely investigated. However, genome assembly is still a challenging task.Methods and ResultsWe systematically evaluated the performance of nine de novo assemblers for ONT on different coverage depth datasets. Several metrics were measured to determine the performance of these tools, including N50 length, sequence coverage, runtime, easy operation, accuracy of genome and genomic completeness in varying depths of coverage. Based on the results of our assessments, the performances of these tools are summarized as follows: 1) Coverage depth has a significant effect on genome quality; 2) The level of contiguity of the assembled genome varies dramatically among different de novo tools; 3) The correctness of an assembled genome is closely related to the completeness of the genome. More than 30{\texttimes} nanopore data can be assembled into a relatively complete genome, the quality of which is highly dependent on the polishing using next generation sequencing data.ConclusionConsidering the results of our investigation, the advantage and disadvantage of each tool are summarized and guidelines of selecting assembly tools are provided under specific conditions.},

  abstract = {The intestinal mucosa is a monolayer of rapidly self-renewing epithelial cells which is not only responsible for absorption of water and nutrients into the bloodstream but also acts as a protective barrier against harmful microbes entering the body. New functional epithelial cells are produced from stem cells, and their proliferating progeny. These stem cells are found within millions of crypts (tubular pits) spaced along the intestinal tract. The entire intestinal epithelium is replaced every 2{\textendash}3 days in mice (3{\textendash}5 days in humans) and hence cell production, differentiation, migration and turnover need to be tightly regulated. Malfunctions in this regulation are strongly linked to inflammatory bowel diseases and to the formation of adenomas and ultimately cancerous tumours. Despite a great deal of biological experimentation and observation, precisely how colonic crypts are regulated to produce mature colonocytes remains unclear. To assist in understanding how cell organisation in crypts is achieved, two very different conceptual models of cell behaviour are developed here, referred to as the `pedigree' and the `niche' models. The pedigree model proposes that crypt cells are largely preprogrammed and receive minimal prompting from the environment as they move through a routine of cell differentiation and proliferation to become mature colonocytes. The niche model proposes that crypt cells are primarily influenced by the local microenvironments along the crypt, and that predetermined cell behaviour plays a negligible role in their development. In this paper we present a computational model of colonic crypts in the mouse, which enables a comparison of the quality and controllability of mature coloncyte production by crypts operating under these two contrasting conceptual models of crypt regulation.},

  abstract = {The genetic diversity and expression of the [NiFe] hydrogenase large-subunit gene of Desulfovibrio spp. in environmental samples were determined in order to show in parallel the existing and active members of Desulfovibrio populations. DNA and total RNA were extracted from different anaerobic bioreactor samples; RNA was transcribed into cDNA. Subsequently, PCR was performed to amplify a ca.-440-bp fragment of the [NiFe] hydrogenase large-subunit gene and its mRNA. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis was used to separate the PCR products according to their sequence and thereby to visualize the individual community members. Desulfovibrio strains corresponding to amplified [NiFe] hydrogenase transcripts were regarded as metabolically active, because in pure cultures transcripts were detectable in exponentially growing cells but not in cultures in the stationary phase. DNA sequencing and comparative sequence analysis were used to identify the detected organisms on the basis of their [NiFe] hydrogenase sequences. The genes of characterized Desulfovibrio spp. showed a considerable extent of divergence (ca. 30\%), whereas sequences obtained from bacterial populations of the bioreactors showed a low level of variation and indicated the coexistence of closely related strains probably belonging to the species Desulfovibrio sulfodismutans. Under methanogenic conditions, all detected populations were active; under denitrifying conditions, no [NiFe] hydrogenase mRNA was visible. Changes in activity and composition of Desulfovibrio populations caused by changes in the environmental conditions could be monitored by using the approach described in this study.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccination is recommended for all individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including those on immunosuppressive therapies; however, little is known about vaccine safety and efficacy in these patients or the impact of vaccination on IBD disease course. METHODS: We evaluated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine-related adverse events (AEs) and the effect of vaccination on IBD disease course among participants in the PREVENT-COVID (Partnership to Report Effectiveness of Vaccination in populations Excluded from iNitial Trials of COVID) study, a prospective, observational cohort study. Localized and systemic reactions were assessed via questionnaire. Disease flare was defined by worsening IBD symptoms and change in IBD medications. Outcomes were stratified by vaccine type and IBD medication classes. RESULTS: A total of 3316 individuals with IBD received at least 1 COVID-19 vaccine. Injection site tenderness (68\%) and fatigue (46\% dose 1, 68\% dose 2) were the most commonly reported localized and systemic AEs after vaccination. Severe localized and systemic vaccine-related AEs were rare. The mRNA-1273 vaccine was associated with significantly greater severe AEs at dose 2 (localized 4\% vs 2\%, systemic 15\% vs 10\%; P {$<$} .001 for both). Prior COVID-19 infection, female sex, and vaccine type were associated with severe systemic reactions to dose 1, while age {$<$}50 years, female sex, vaccine type, and antitumor necrosis factor and vedolizumab use were associated with severe systemic reactions to dose 2. Overall rates (2\%) of IBD flare were low following vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide reassurance that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine is safe and well tolerated among individuals with IBD, which may help to combat vaccine hesitancy and increase vaccine confidence.},

  abstract = {Technological developments have led to an explosion of high-throughput single cell data, which are revealing unprecedented perspectives on cell identity. Recently, significant attention has focused on investigating, from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, cellular dynamic processes, such as cell differentiation, cell cycle and cell (de)activation. Trajectory inference methods estimate a trajectory, a collection of differentiation paths of a dynamic system, by ordering cells along the paths of such a dynamic process. While trajectory inference tools typically work with gene expression levels, common scRNA-seq protocols allow the identification and quantification of unspliced pre-mRNAs and mature spliced mRNAs, for each gene. By exploiting the abundance of unspliced and spliced mRNA, one can infer the RNA velocity of individual cells, i.e., the time derivative of the gene expression state of cells. Whereas traditional trajectory inference methods reconstruct cellular dynamics given a population of cells of varying maturity, RNA velocity relies on a dynamical model describing splicing dynamics. Here, we initially discuss conceptual and theoretical aspects of both approaches, then illustrate how they can be combined together, and finally present an example use-case on real data.},

  abstract = {Single-cell expression profiling reveals the molecular states of individual cells with unprecedented detail. Because these methods destroy cells in the process of analysis, they cannot measure how gene expression changes over time. However, some information on dynamics is present in the data: the continuum of molecular states in the population can reflect the trajectory of a typical cell. Many methods for extracting single-cell dynamics from population data have been proposed. However, all such attempts face a common limitation: for any measured distribution of cell states, there are multiple dynamics that could give rise to it, and by extension, multiple possibilities for underlying mechanisms of gene regulation. Here, we describe the aspects of gene expression dynamics that cannot be inferred from a static snapshot alone and identify assumptions necessary to constrain a unique solution for cell dynamics from static snapshots. We translate these constraints into a practical algorithmic approach, population balance analysis (PBA), which makes use of a method from spectral graph theory to solve a class of high-dimensional differential equations. We use simulations to show the strengths and limitations of PBA, and then apply it to single-cell profiles of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Cell state predictions from this analysis agree with HPC fate assays reported in several papers over the past two decades. By highlighting the fundamental limits on dynamic inference faced by any method, our framework provides a rigorous basis for dynamic interpretation of a gene expression continuum and clarifies best experimental designs for trajectory reconstruction from static snapshot measurements.},

  abstract = {Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) belong to a family of transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes required for the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol. Three SREBP isoforms, SREBP1a, SREBP1c, and SREBP2, have been identified in mammalian cells. SREBP1a and SREBP1c are derived from a single gene through the use of alternative transcription start sites. Here we investigated the role of SREBP-mediated lipogenesis in regulating tumor growth and initiation in colon cancer. Knockdown of either SREBP1 or SREBP2 decreased levels of fatty acids as a result of decreased expression of SREBP target genes required for lipid biosynthesis in colon cancer cells. Bioenergetic analysis revealed that silencing SREBP1 or SREBP2 expression reduced the mitochondrial respiration, glycolysis, as well as fatty acid oxidation indicating an alteration in cellular metabolism. Consequently, the rate of cell proliferation and the ability of cancer cells to form tumor spheroids in suspension culture were significantly decreased. Similar results were obtained in colon cancer cells in which the proteolytic activation of SREBP was blocked. Importantly, knockdown of either SREBP1 or SREBP2 inhibited xenograft tumor growth in vivo and decreased the expression of genes associated with cancer stem cells. Taken together, our findings establish the molecular basis of SREBP-dependent metabolic regulation and provide a rationale for targeting lipid biosynthesis as a promising approach in colon cancer treatment.},

Here, we use spatially resolved anomalous dispersion (SpReAD) refinement to determine oxidation assignments for the individual irons for each state. Additionally, we report the 1.13-{\AA} resolution structure for the ADP bound Fe-protein, the highest resolution Fe-protein structure presently determined. In the dithionite-reduced [4Fe:4S]1+ state, our analysis identifies a solvent exposed, delocalized Fe2.5+ pair and a buried Fe2+ pair. We propose that ATP binding by the Fe-protein promotes an internal redox rearrangement such that the solvent-exposed Fe pair becomes reduced, thereby facilitating electron transfer to the nitrogenase molybdenum iron-protein. In the [4Fe:4S]0 and [4Fe:4S]2+ states, the SpReAD analysis supports oxidation states assignments for all irons in these clusters of Fe2+ and valence delocalized Fe2.5+, respectively.},

  abstract = {The quality of genome assemblies has improved rapidly in recent years due to continual advances in sequencing technology, assembly approaches, and quality control. In the field of molecular ecology, this has led to the development of exceptional quality genome assemblies that will be important long-term resources for broader studies into ecological, conservation, evolutionary, and population genomics of naturally occurring species. Moreover, the extent to which a single reference genome represents the diversity within a species varies: pan-genomes will become increasingly important ecological genomics resources, particularly in systems found to have considerable presence-absence variation in their functional content. Here, we highlight advances in technology that have raised the bar for genome assembly and provide guidance on standards to achieve exceptional quality reference genomes. Key recommendations include the following: (a) Genome assemblies should include long-read sequencing except in rare cases where it is effectively impossible to acquire adequately preserved samples needed for high molecular weight DNA standards. (b) At least one scaffolding approach should be included with genome assembly such as Hi-C or optical mapping. (c) Genome assemblies should be carefully evaluated, this may involve utilising short read data for genome polishing, error correction, k-mer analyses, and estimating the percent of reads that map back to an assembly. Finally, a genome assembly is most valuable if all data and methods are made publicly available and the utility of a genome for further studies is verified through examples. While these recommendations are based on current technology, we anticipate that future advances will push the field further and the molecular ecology community should continue to adopt new approaches that attain the highest quality genome assemblies.},

Epidemiological evidence suggested that these cases represented sexual transmission from persistently infected, asymptomatic EVD survivors. To address these questions, we directly sequenced EBOV from clinical specimens collected during acute and persistent infection from individuals associated with these re-emerged EVD cases. This sequence analysis was used in conjunction with on-the-ground epidemiological tracing to identify transmission chains and potential routes of infection. Due to a lack of knowledge regarding the effect of persistence on Ebola viral sequences, we were unable to support or refute whether these re-emerged cases represented evidence of transmission from EVD survivors, despite extensive phylogenetic analysis. To address this knowledge gap, we also sequenced Ebola virus directly from the semen of EVD survivors (`SAVS'{\textemdash}semen-acquired viral sequences) and identified molecular characteristics associated with viral persistence. Through extensive use of phylogenetic software and models, we identified that a subset of SAVS exhibited evidence of a slowed or acute-like substitution rates, de novo U-to-T hyper-editing and a moderate change in evolutionary pressure within the viral glycoprotein. Altogether, our data illustrate that phylogenetic analysis and evolutionary hypothesis testing can yield important insights into disease transmission networks and the mechanisms of viral replication.},

  abstract = {Background:~Data sets from long-read sequencing platforms (Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Pacific Biosciences) allow for most prokaryote genomes to be completely assembled {\textendash} one contig per chromosome or plasmid. However, the high per-read error rate of long-read sequencing necessitates different approaches to assembly than those used for short-read sequencing. Multiple assembly tools (assemblers) exist, which use a variety of algorithms for long-read assembly.,  Methods:~We used 500 simulated read sets and 120 real read sets to assess the performance of eight long-read assemblers (Canu, Flye, Miniasm/Minipolish, NECAT, NextDenovo/NextPolish, Raven, Redbean and Shasta) across a wide variety of genomes and read parameters. Assemblies were assessed on their structural accuracy/completeness, sequence identity, contig circularisation and computational resources used.,  Results:~Canu v2.1 produced reliable assemblies and was good with plasmids, but it performed poorly with circularisation and had the longest runtimes of all assemblers tested. Flye v2.8 was also reliable and made the smallest sequence errors, though it used the most RAM. Miniasm/Minipolish v0.3/v0.1.3 was the most likely to produce clean contig circularisation. NECAT v20200803 was reliable and good at circularisation but tended to make larger sequence errors. NextDenovo/NextPolish v2.3.1/v1.3.1 was reliable with chromosome assembly but bad with plasmid assembly.

  abstract = {Background:\&nbsp; Data sets from long-read sequencing platforms (Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Pacific Biosciences) allow for most prokaryote genomes to be completely assembled {\textendash} one contig per chromosome or plasmid. However, the high per-read error rate of long-read sequencing necessitates different approaches to assembly than those used for short-read sequencing. Multiple assembly tools (assemblers) exist, which use a variety of algorithms for long-read assembly. Methods:\&nbsp; We used 500 simulated read sets and 120 real read sets to assess the performance of eight long-read assemblers (Canu, Flye, Miniasm/Minipolish, NECAT, NextDenovo/NextPolish, Raven, Redbean and Shasta) across a wide variety of genomes and read parameters. Assemblies were assessed on their structural accuracy/completeness, sequence identity, contig circularisation and computational resources used. Results:\&nbsp; Canu v2.1 produced reliable assemblies and was good with plasmids, but it performed poorly with circularisation and had the longest runtimes of all assemblers tested. Flye v2.8 was also reliable and made the smallest sequence errors, though it used the most RAM. Miniasm/Minipolish v0.3/v0.1.3 was the most likely to produce clean contig circularisation. NECAT v20200803 was reliable and good at circularisation but tended to make larger sequence errors. NextDenovo/NextPolish v2.3.1/v1.3.1 was reliable with chromosome assembly but bad with plasmid assembly. Raven v1.3.0 was reliable for chromosome assembly, though it did not perform well on small plasmids and had circularisation issues. Redbean v2.5 and Shasta v0.7.0 were computationally efficient but more likely to produce incomplete assemblies. Conclusions:\&nbsp; Of the assemblers tested, Flye, Miniasm/Minipolish,\&nbsp;NextDenovo/NextPolish and Raven performed best overall. However, no single tool performed well on all metrics, highlighting the need for continued development on long-read assembly algorithms.},

As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

However, these methods often generate multiplet artifacts, where two or more cells receive the same barcode, resulting in a hybrid transcriptome. In most experiments, multiplets account for several percent of transcriptomes and can confound downstream data analysis. Here, we present Single-Cell Remover of Doublets (Scrublet), a framework for predicting the impact of multiplets in a given analysis and identifying problematic multiplets. Scrublet avoids the need for expert knowledge or cell clustering by simulating multiplets from the data and building a nearest neighbor classifier. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we test Scrublet on several datasets that include independent knowledge of cell multiplets.

Although there are many existing methods attempting to address this task, most of them can either work only on certain types of Web pages, e.g. article pages, or has to develop different models for different websites. We formulate the actual content identifying problem as a DOM tree node selection problem. We develop multiple features by utilizing the DOM tree node properties to train a machine learning model. Then candidate nodes are selected based on the learning model. Based on the observation that the actual content is usually located in a spatially continuous block, we develop a grouping technology to further filter out noisy data and pick missing data for the candidate nodes. We conduct extensive experiments on a real dataset and demonstrate our solution has high quality outputs and outperforms several baseline methods.},

Existing gene set tests that rely on gene permutation are shown here to be extremely sensitive to inter-gene correlation. Several data sets are analyzed to show that inter-gene correlation is non-ignorable even for experiments on homogeneous cell populations using genetically identical model organisms. A new gene set test procedure (CAMERA) is proposed based on the idea of estimating the inter-gene correlation from the data, and using it to adjust the gene set test statistic. An efficient procedure is developed for estimating the inter-gene correlation and characterizing its precision. CAMERA is shown to control the type I error rate correctly regardless of inter-gene correlations, yet retains excellent power for detecting genuine differential expression. Analysis of breast cancer data shows that CAMERA recovers known relationships between tumor subtypes in very convincing terms. CAMERA can be used to analyze specified sets or as a pathway analysis tool using a database of molecular signatures.},

Visualizing these datasets is crucial to biological interpretation, and a popular method is t-stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), which visualizes local patterns well but distorts global structure, such as distances between clusters. We developed similarity weighted nonnegative embedding (SWNE), which enhances interpretation of datasets by embedding the genes and factors that separate cell states on the visualization alongside the cells and maintains fidelity when visualizing local and global structure for both developmental trajectories and discrete cell types. SWNE uses nonnegative matrix factorization to decompose the gene expression matrix into biologically relevant factors; embeds the cells, genes, and factors in a 2D visualization; and uses a similarity matrix to smooth the embeddings. We demonstrate SWNE on single-cell RNA-seq data from hematopoietic progenitors and human brain cells. SWNE is available as an R package at github.com/yanwu2014/swne.},

Second, efforts directed towards the identification of environmental factors implicate commensal bacteria (or their products), rather than conventional pathogens, as drivers of dysregulated immunity and IBD. Third, murine models, which exhibit many of the features of ulcerative colitis and seem to be bacteria-driven, have helped unravel the pathogenesis/mucosal immunopathology of IBD.},

  abstract = {In single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), doublets form when two cells are encapsulated into one reaction volume. The existence of doublets, which appear as but are not real cells, is a key confounder in scRNA-seq data analysis. Computational methods have been developed to detect doublets in scRNA-seq data; however, the scRNA-seq field lacks a comprehensive benchmarking of these methods, making it difficult for researchers to choose an appropriate method for specific analyses. We conducted a systematic benchmark study of nine cutting-edge computational doublet-detection methods. Our study included 16 real datasets, which contain experimentally annotated doublets, and 112 realistic synthetic datasets. We compared doublet-detection methods regarding detection accuracy under various experimental settings, impacts on downstream analyses, and computational efficiency. Our results show that existing methods exhibited diverse performance and distinct advantages in different aspects. Overall, the DoubletFinder method has the best detection accuracy, and the cxds method has the highest computational efficiency. A record of this paper's Transparent Peer Review process is included in the .,                     , We conduct a systematic benchmark study of nine cutting-edge computational doublet-detection methods. We evaluate the methods' detection accuracy, impacts on downstream analyses, and computational efficiency, using a comprehensive set of real and synthetic data. Although no method dominates in all aspects, the DoubletFinder and cxds methods have the best detection accuracy and computational efficiency, respectively.},

  abstract = {The E2F family of transcription factors (E2Fs) consist of eight genes in mammals. These genes encode ten proteins that are usually classified as transcriptional activators or transcriptional repressors. E2Fs are important for many cellular processes, from their canonical role in cell cycle regulation to other roles in angiogenesis, the DNA damage response and apoptosis. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are key players in tumor development, metastasis, drug resistance and recurrence. This review focuses on the role of E2Fs in CSCs and notes that many signals can regulate the activities of E2Fs, which in turn can transcriptionally regulate many different targets to contribute to various biological characteristics of CSCs, such as proliferation, self-renewal, metastasis, and drug resistance. Therefore, E2Fs may be promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets associated with CSCs pathologies. Finally, exploring therapeutic strategies for E2Fs may result in disruption of CSCs, which may prevent tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance.},

  abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and recurrent inflammatory disorder that primarily comprises Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Owing to its increasing prevalence in Eastern countries and the intractable challenges faced during IBD treatment, extensive research on IBD has been carried out over the last few years. Although the precise aetiology of IBD is undefined, the currently accepted hypothesis for IBD pathogenesis considers it to be a combination of environment, genetic predisposition, gut microbiota, and abnormal immunity. A recently emerged signalling pathway, the Hippo pathway, acts as a key regulator of cell growth, tissue homoeostasis, organ size, and has been implicated in several human cancers. In the past few years, studies have revealed the importance of the Hippo pathway in gastrointestinal tract physiology and gastrointestinal diseases, such as colorectal cancer and IBD. However, the role of the Hippo pathway and its exact impact in IBD remains to be elucidated. This review summarises the latest scientific literature on the involvement of this pathway in IBD from the following perspectives that account for the IBD pathogenesis: intestinal epithelial cell regeneration, immune regulation, gut microbiota, and angiogenesis. A comprehensive understanding of the specific role of the Hippo pathway in IBD will provide novel insights into future research directions and clinical implications of the Hippo pathway.},

However, it is not straightforward to compare gene expression levels across datasets and to automatically assign cell type labels in a new dataset based on existing annotations. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that our previously developed method, scVI, provides an effective and fully probabilistic approach for joint representation and analysis of scRNA-seq data, while accounting for uncertainty caused by biological and measurement noise. We also introduce single-cell ANnotation using Variational Inference (scANVI), a semi-supervised variant of scVI designed to leverage existing cell state annotations. We demonstrate that scVI and scANVI compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods for data integration and cell state annotation in terms of accuracy, scalability, and adaptability to challenging settings. In contrast to existing methods, scVI and scANVI integrate multiple datasets with a single generative model that can be directly used for downstream tasks, such as differential expression. Both methods are easily accessible through scvi-tools.},

In recent years single-molecule sequencing techniques generating long-read information have become available and enabled substantial improvement in contig length and genome completeness, especially for large genomes (\&gt;100 Mb), although bioinformatic tools for these applications are still limited.We developed a software tool to close sequence gaps in genome assemblies, TGS-GapCloser, that uses low-depth ({$\sim$}10{\texttimes}) long single-molecule reads. The algorithm extracts reads that bridge gap regions between 2 contigs within a scaffold, error corrects only the candidate reads, and assigns the best sequence data to each gap. As a demonstration, we used TGS-GapCloser to improve the scaftig NG50 value of 3 human genome assemblies by 24-fold on average with only {$\sim$}10{\texttimes} coverage of Oxford Nanopore or Pacific Biosciences reads, covering with sequence data up to 94.8\% gaps with 97.7\% positive predictive value. These improved assemblies achieve 99.998\% (Q46) single-base accuracy with final inserted sequences having 99.97\% (Q35) accuracy, despite the high raw error rate of single-molecule reads, enabling high-quality downstream analyses, including up to a 31-fold increase in the scaftig NGA50 and up to 13.1\% more complete BUSCO genes. Additionally, we show that even in ultra-large genome assemblies, such as the ginkgo ({$\sim$}12 Gb), TGS-GapCloser can cover 71.6\% of gaps with sequence data.TGS-GapCloser can close gaps in large genome assemblies using raw long reads quickly and cost-effectively. The final assemblies generated by TGS-GapCloser have improved contiguity and completeness while maintaining high accuracy. The software is available at https://github.com/BGI-Qingdao/TGS-GapCloser.},

Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic factors that affect the risk for Crohn's disease in European populations, but information from other ethnic groups is scarce. We therefore investigated genetic factors associated with Crohn's disease in the Japanese population. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study with 372 individuals with Crohn's disease (cases) and 3389 controls, all from the Japanese population. To confirm identified associations, we performed a replication study with an independent panel of 1151 Crohn's disease cases and 15,800 controls. We also performed an association analysis using genome-wide genotype imputation in the discovery cohort. RESULTS: We confirmed associations of Crohn's disease with variants in MHC (rs7765379, P = 2.11 {\texttimes} 10(-59)), TNFSF15 (rs6478106, P = 3.87 {\texttimes} 10(-45)), and STAT3 (rs9891119, P = 2.24 {\texttimes} 10(-14)). We identified 2 new susceptibility loci: on chromosome 4p14 (rs1487630, P = 2.40 {\texttimes} 10(-11); odds ratio, 1.33), and in the SLC25A15-ELF1-WBP4 region on 13q14 (rs7329174 in ELF1, P = 5.12 {\texttimes} 10(-9); odds ratio, 1.27). CONCLUSIONS: In a genome-wide association study, we identified 2 new susceptibility loci for Crohn's disease in a Japanese population. These findings could increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease.},

The regulatory mechanism of ISCs is not fully understood. Here we report that CREPT, a recently identified tumor-promoting protein, is required for the maintenance of murine ISCs. CREPT is preferably expressed in the crypts but not in the villi. Deletion of CREPT in the intestinal epithelium of mice (Vil-CREPTKO) results in lower body weight and slow migration of epithelial cells in the intestine. Vil-CREPTKO intestine fails to regenerate after X-ray irradiation and~dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) treatment. Accordingly, the deletion of CREPT decreases the expression of genes related to the proliferation and differentiation of ISCs and reduces Lgr5+ cell numbers at homeostasis. We identify that CREPT deficiency downregulates Wnt signaling by impairing {$\beta$}-catenin accumulation in the nucleus of the crypt cells during regeneration.

We compare four major dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, multidimensional scaling [MDS], t-SNE, and UMAP) in analyzing 71 large bulk transcriptomic datasets. UMAP is superior to PCA and MDS but shows some advantages over t-SNE in differentiating batch effects, identifying pre-defined biological groups, and revealing in-depth clusters in two-dimensional space.

Here, we introduced an evolving lineage-tracing system with a single-cell RNA-seq readout into a mouse model of Kras;Trp53(KP)-driven lung adenocarcinoma and tracked tumor evolution from single-transformed cells to metastatic tumors at unprecedented resolution. We found that the loss of the initial, stable alveolar-type2-like state was accompanied by a transient increase in plasticity. This was followed by the adoption of distinct transcriptional programs that enable rapid expansion and, ultimately, clonal sweep of stable subclones capable of metastasizing. Finally, tumors develop through stereotypical evolutionary trajectories, and perturbing additional tumor suppressors accelerates progression by creating novel trajectories. Our study elucidates the hierarchical nature of tumor evolution and, more broadly, enables in-depth studies of tumor progression.},

  abstract = {With the rapid increase in genome sequencing projects for non-model organisms, numerous genome assemblies are currently in progress or available as drafts, but not made available as satisfactory, usable genomes. Data quality assessment of genome assemblies is gaining importance not only for people who perform the assembly/re-assembly processes, but also for those who attempt to use assemblies as maps in downstream analyses. Recent studies of the quality control, quality evaluation/ assessment of genome assemblies have focused on either quality control of reads before assemblies or evaluation of the assemblies with respect to their contiguity and correctness. However, correctness assessment depends on a reference and is not applicable for de novo assembly projects. Hence, development of methods providing both post-assembly and pre-assembly quality assessment reports for examining the quality/correctness of de novo assemblies and the input reads is worth studying.},

Here, we develop a spatial{\textendash}temporal inference methodology using a modified network model in conjunction with the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter, a Bayesian inference method equipped to handle observational errors. The combined method is capable of revealing the spatial{\textendash}temporal progression of infectious disease, while requiring only limited, readily compiled data. We use this method to reconstruct the transmission network of the 2014{\textendash}2015 Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone and identify source and sink regions. Our inference suggests that, in Sierra Leone, transmission within the network introduced Ebola to neighbouring districts and initiated self-sustaining local epidemics; two of the more populous and connected districts, Kenema and Port Loko, facilitated two independent transmission pathways. Epidemic intensity differed by district, was highly correlated with population size (r = 0.76, p = 0.0015) and a critical window of opportunity for containing local Ebola epidemics at the source (ca one month) existed. This novel methodology can be used to help identify and contain the spatial expansion of future (re)emerging infectious disease outbreaks.},

  abstract = {Background: Paspalum notatum is a diploid multi-purpose subtropical herb native to South America. Its chromosome length is 2n=20XX and has a high ecological significance. It is currently widely planted in tropical and subtropical regions. Despite the gene pool of P. notatum being unearthed to a large extent in the past decade, no details about the genomic information of relevant species in Paspalum have been reported. In this study, the complete genome information of P. notatum was established and annotated through sequencing and de novo assembly of its genome. Results: The latest PacBio third-generation HiFi assembly and sequencing revealed that the genome size of P. notatum is 541M. The assembly result is the highest index among the genomes of the gramineous family published so far, with a contig N50=52Mbp, scaffold N50=49Mbp, and BUSCOs=98.1\%, accounting for 98.5\% of the estimated genome. Genome annotation revealed 36511 high-confidence gene models, thus providing an important resource for future molecular breeding and evolutionary research. A comparison of the genome annotation results of P. notatum with other closely related species revealed that it had a close relationship with Zea mays. An analysis of the expansion and contraction of gene families suggested that P. notatum contains gene families associated with environmental resistance, increased reproductive ability, and molecular evolution, which explained its excellent agronomic traits. Conclusion: This study is the first to report the high-quality chromosome-scale-based genome of P. notatum assembled using the latest PacBio third-generation HiFi sequencing reads. The study provides an excellent genetic resource bank for gramineous crops and invaluable perspectives regarding the evolution of gramineous plants.},

The transcriptomes of multiple cycling ISC populations closely resembled Lgr5+ ISCs, the most well-defined ISC pool, but Bmi1-GFP+ cells were distinct and enriched for enteroendocrine (EE) markers, including Prox1. Prox1-GFP+ cells exhibited sustained clonogenic growth in~vitro, and lineage-tracing of Prox1+ cells revealed long-lived clones during homeostasis and after radiation-induced injury in~vivo. Single-cell mRNA-seq revealed two subsets of Prox1-GFP+ cells, one of which resembled mature EE cells while the other displayed low-level EE gene expression but co-expressed tuft cell markers, Lgr5 and Ascl2, reminiscent of label-retaining secretory progenitors. Our data suggest that the EE lineage, including mature EE cells, comprises a reservoir of homeostatic and injury-inducible ISCs, extending our understanding of cellular plasticity and stemness.},

Bmi1 and Lgr5 have been independently identified to mark long-lived multipotent ISCs by lineage tracing in mice; however, the functional distinctions between these two populations remain undefined. Here, we demonstrate that Bmi1 and Lgr5 mark two functionally distinct ISCs in vivo. Lgr5 marks mitotically active ISCs that exhibit exquisite sensitivity to canonical Wnt modulation, contribute robustly to homeostatic regeneration, and are quantitatively ablated by irradiation. In contrast, Bmi1 marks quiescent ISCs that are insensitive to Wnt perturbations, contribute weakly to homeostatic regeneration, and are resistant to high-dose radiation injury. After irradiation, however, the normally quiescent Bmi1+ ISCs dramatically proliferate to clonally repopulate multiple contiguous crypts and villi. Clonogenic culture of isolated single Bmi1+ ISCs yields long-lived self-renewing spheroids of intestinal epithelium that produce Lgr5-expressing cells, thereby establishing a lineage relationship between these two populations in vitro. Taken together, these data provide direct evidence that Bmi1 marks quiescent, injury-inducible reserve ISCs that exhibit striking functional distinctions from Lgr5+ ISCs and support a model whereby distinct ISC populations facilitate homeostatic vs. injury-induced regeneration.},

  abstract = {The canonical Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin signalling pathway governs diverse developmental, homeostatic and pathological processes. Palmitoylated Wnt ligands engage cell-surface frizzled (FZD) receptors and LRP5 and LRP6 co-receptors, enabling {$\beta$}-catenin nuclear translocation and TCF/LEF-dependent gene transactivation. Mutations in Wnt downstream signalling components have revealed diverse functions thought to be carried out by Wnt ligands themselves. However, redundancy between the 19 mammalian Wnt proteins and 10 FZD receptors and Wnt hydrophobicity have made it difficult to attribute these functions directly to Wnt ligands. For example, individual mutations in Wnt ligands have not revealed homeostatic phenotypes in the intestinal epithelium-an archetypal canonical, Wnt pathway-dependent, rapidly self-renewing tissue, the regeneration of which is fueled by proliferative crypt Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs). R-spondin ligands (RSPO1-RSPO4) engage distinct LGR4-LGR6, RNF43 and ZNRF3 receptor classes, markedly potentiate canonical Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin signalling, and induce intestinal organoid growth in vitro and Lgr5+ ISCs in vivo. However, the interchangeability, functional cooperation and relative contributions of Wnt versus RSPO ligands to in vivo canonical Wnt signalling and ISC biology remain unknown. Here we identify the functional roles of Wnt and RSPO ligands in the intestinal crypt stem-cell niche. We show that the default fate of Lgr5+ ISCs is to differentiate, unless both RSPO and Wnt ligands are present. However, gain-of-function studies using RSPO ligands and a new non-lipidated Wnt analogue reveal that these ligands have qualitatively distinct, non-interchangeable roles in ISCs. Wnt proteins are unable to induce Lgr5+ ISC self-renewal, but instead confer a basal competency by maintaining RSPO receptor expression that enables RSPO ligands to actively drive and specify the extent of stem-cell expansion. This functionally non-equivalent yet cooperative interaction between Wnt and RSPO ligands establishes a molecular precedent for regulation of mammalian stem cells by distinct priming and self-renewal factors, with broad implications for precise control of tissue regeneration.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are at risk for developing colorectal cancer (CRC), despite the development of new therapeutic agents. Stratification of the individual UC-patient's risk would be helpful to validate the risk factors for CRC. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors for the development of CRC in a large cohort of patients with UC. METHODS: Data were obtained from 12 hospitals in the Kyoto-Shiga region during 2003-2013. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 2137 patients with UC. RESULTS: In total, 60 lesions of CRC were detected in 43 (2.0\%) of 2137 patients. 30 of the 43 patients were male. The median age was 53\hspace{0.25em}years. The median duration of disease was 13\hspace{0.25em}years, and 67.4\% of these patients had a disease duration {$>$}10\hspace{0.25em}years. Of the 43 patients, 34 (79.1\%) had extensive colitis. Primary sclerosing cholangitis was detected in 2 patients (4.7\%). The median corticosteroids (CS) dose was 6.4\hspace{0.25em}g, and 4 patients were treated with a total of more than 10\hspace{0.25em}g of CS. 18 of these patients underwent more than 1\hspace{0.25em}year CS treatment. Of all 60 CRC lesions, 43 (71.7\%) were located in the distal colon and 35 (58.3\%) were of the superficial type. Moreover, the stage of CRC was stage 0 or I in 55.8\% of the 43 patients with CRC. Multivariate analysis suggested that extensive colitis could be a risk factor for the development of advanced CRC in patients with UC. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that male, extensive colitis, long-term duration of UC and family history of CRC, but not concomitant primary sclerosing cholangitis, are important factors for predicting CRC in Japanese patients with UC. Moreover, long-standing extensive colitis might contribute to the progression of CRC. Further studies are required to establish CRC surveillance in Japanese patients with UC.},

  abstract = {Tissue regeneration requires dynamic cellular adaptation to the wound environment. It is currently unclear how this is orchestrated at the cellular level and how cell fate is affected by severe tissue damage. Here we dissect cell fate transitions during colonic regeneration in a mouse dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis model, and we demonstrate that the epithelium is transiently reprogrammed into a primitive state. This is characterized by de novo expression of fetal markers as well as suppression of markers for adult stem and differentiated cells. The fate change is orchestrated by remodeling the~extracellular matrix (ECM), increased FAK/Src signaling, and ultimately YAP/TAZ activation. In a defined cell culture system recapitulating the extracellular matrix remodeling observed in~vivo, we show that a collagen 3D matrix supplemented with Wnt ligands is sufficient to sustain endogenous YAP/TAZ and induce conversion of cell fate. This provides a simple model for tissue regeneration, implicating cellular reprogramming as an essential element.,                                        {\textbullet}               The repairing epithelium can be isolated based on Sca1 expression                                         {\textbullet}               Markers upregulated during tissue repair are expressed in the fetal intestine                                         {\textbullet}               Mechano-transduction via FAK, Src, and YAP/TAZ facilitate efficient tissue repair                                         {\textbullet}               YAP/TAZ activation is required and sufficient to induce cellular reprogramming                                 , The mechanism that governs tissue regeneration following severe damage to the colonic epithelium remains poorly understood. Jensen and colleagues show that the colonic epithelium undergoes a profound reprogramming into a more primitive state with fetal-like properties. Moreover, they demonstrate that YAP and TAZ operate as essential mechano-sensors during tissue reprogramming.},

  abstract = {AIM: Activation of transcription factor nuclear factor-{$\kappa$}B (NF-{$\kappa$}B) has been shown to play a role in cell proliferation, apoptosis, cytokine production, and oncogenesis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether NF-{$\kappa$}B was constitutively activated in human colorectal tumor tissues and, if so, to determine the role of NF-{$\kappa$}B in colorectal tumorigenesis, and furthermore, to determine the association of RelA expression with tumor cell apoptosis and the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL., METHODS: Paraffin sections of normal epithelial, adenomatous and adenocarcinoma tissues were analysed immunohisto- chemically for expression of RelA, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was used to confirm the increased nuclear translocation of RelA in colorectal tumor tissues. The mRNA expressions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Apoptotic cells were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate fluorescence nick end labeling (TUNEL) method., RESULTS: The activity of NF-{$\kappa$}B was significantly higher in adenocarcinoma tissue in comparison with that in adenomatous and normal epithelial tissues. The apoptotic index (AI) significantly decreased in the transition from adenoma to adenocarcinoma. Meanwhile, the expressions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL protein and their mRNAs were significantly higher in adenocarcinoma tissues than that in adenomatous and normal epithelial tissues., CONCLUSION: NF-{$\kappa$}B may inhibit apoptosis via enhancing the expression of the apoptosis genes Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. And the increased expression of RelA/nuclear factor-{$\kappa$}B plays an important role in the pathogenesis of colorectal carcinoma.},

The research scope of pyroptosis has expanded with the discovery of the gasdermin family. A great deal of evidence shows that pyroptosis can affect the development of tumors. The relationship between pyroptosis and tumors is diverse in different tissues and genetic backgrounds. In this review, we provide basic knowledge of pyroptosis, explain the relationship between pyroptosis and tumors, and focus on the significance of pyroptosis in tumor treatment. In addition, we further summarize the possibility of pyroptosis as a potential tumor treatment strategy and describe the side effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy caused by pyroptosis. In brief, pyroptosis is a double-edged sword for tumors. The rational use of this dual effect will help us further explore the formation and development of tumors, and provide ideas for patients to develop new drugs based on pyroptosis.},

Proteins of the serine/arginine (SR)-rich splicing factor family are major splicing regulators that are broadly required for organ development as well as cell and organism viability. However, how these proteins support adult organ function remains largely unknown. Here, we used the continuously growing mouse incisor as a model to dissect the functions of the prototypical SR family protein SRSF1 during tissue homeostasis and renewal. We identified an SRSF1-governed alternative splicing network that is specifically required for dental proliferation and survival of progenitors but dispensable for the viability of differentiated cells. We also observed a similar progenitor-specific role of SRSF1 in the small intestinal epithelium, indicating a conserved function of SRSF1 across adult epithelial tissues. Thus, our findings define a regulatory mechanism by which SRSF1 specifically controls progenitor-specific alternative splicing events to support adult tissue~homeostasis and renewal.},

Current TI methods can be categorized into those using RNA velocity information and those using only singlecell gene expression data. The latter type of methods are restricted to certain trajectory structures, and cannot determine cell developmental direction. Recently proposed TI methods using RNA velocity information have limited accuracy. We present CellPath, a method that infers cell trajectories by integrating singlecell gene expression and RNA velocity information. CellPath overcomes the restrictions of TI methods that do not use RNA velocity information: it can find multiple high-resolution trajectories without constraints on the trajectory structure, and can automatically detect the direction of each trajectory path. We evaluate CellPath on both real and simulated datasets and show that CellPath finds more accurate and detailed trajectories than the state-of-the-art TI methods using or not using RNA velocity information.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Ulcerative colitis is a severe disease affecting human health worldwide. Studies have shown that lncRNA MALAT1 has a significant correlation with breast, pancreatic, colon and liver cancers, but its effects on colitis is yet to be discovered. In this study, the potential role of lncRNA MALAT1 and the underlying molecular mechanism in DSS-induced colitis were investigated in vitro.Methods: Colorectal mucosal cell line FHC was induced with dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) to form an in vitro colitis model. Transfection procedure was employed to up- or down-regulate the expressions of lncRNA MALAT1 or miR-30c-5p in FHC cells. Cell viabilities were detected by CCK-8 assay. RT-qPCR was applied for evaluating gene expressions in normal FHC and DSS-induced FHC cell lines, while protein expression levels of target genes were examined by Western blot analysis. Starbase was used to predict the molecular interaction between MALAT1 and miR-30c-5p, while luciferase reporter assay was utilized to verify the binding sites between the two genes.Results: Expression of MALAT1 in the DSS-induced FHC cells was high with low cell viabilities, compared to the normal FHC cells. In the DSS-induced colitis-like FHC cells, overexpression of MALAT1 inhibited cell viabilities, while its downregulation promoted it. MiR-30c-5p directly targets MALAT1 and inhibited its expression in DSS-treated FHC cells. Upregulation of miR-30c-5p increased cell viabilities. Bcl-xL expression was inhibited by the up-regulation of MALAT1, while that of Bax was enhanced and the mimics of miR-30c-5p reversed these observations, suggesting that the enhancement of apoptosis promoted by oe-MALAT1 could be inhibited by miR-30c-5p. The interaction between MALAT1 and miR-30c-5p regulated NF-{$\kappa$}B/TGF-{$\beta$}/Wnt-{$\beta$}-catenin signaling pathway.Conclusion: Overexpression of MALAT1 led to inhibition of cell viability, while apoptosis and inflammation were promoted by targeting miR-30c-5p via NF-{$\kappa$}B/TGF-{$\beta$}/Wnt-{$\beta$}-catenin signaling pathway. These findings suggest MALAT1 as a therapeutic target for treating colitis. Keywords: Colitis, MALAT1, miR-30c-5p, NF-{$\kappa$}B/TGF-{$\beta$}/Wnt-{$\beta$}-catenin},

We performed scRNA-seq analyses on immune and stromal populations from colorectal cancer patients, identifying specific macrophage and conventional dendritic cell (cDC) subsets as key mediators of cellular cross-talk in the tumor microenvironment. Defining comparable myeloid populations in mouse tumors enabled characterization of their response to myeloid-targeted immunotherapy. Treatment with anti-CSF1R preferentially depleted macrophages with an inflammatory signature but spared macrophage populations that in mouse and human expresses pro-angiogenic/tumorigenic genes. Treatment with a CD40 agonist antibody preferentially activated a cDC population and increased Bhlhe40+ Th1-like cells and CD8+ memory T cells. Our comprehensive analysis of key myeloid subsets in human and mouse identifies critical cellular interactions regulating tumor immunity and defines mechanisms underlying myeloid-targeted immunotherapies currently undergoing clinical testing.},

Here we report on the discovery and characterization of a mitochondrial stress response in mammalian cells. We find that the accumulation of unfolded protein within the mitochondrial matrix results in the transcriptional upregulation of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial stress proteins such as chaperonin 60, chaperonin 10, mtDnaJ and ClpP, but not those encoding stress proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum. Analysis of the chaperonin 60/10 bidirectional promoter identified a CHOP element as the mitochondrial stress response element. Dominant-negative mutant forms of CHOP and overexpression of CHOP revealed that this transcription factor, in association with C/EBP{$\beta$}, regulates expression of mitochondrial stress genes in response to the accumulation of unfolded proteins.},

  abstract = {A combination of next-generation sequencing technologies and mate-pair libraries of large insert sizes is used as a standard method to generate genome assemblies with high contiguity. The third-generation sequencing techniques also are used to improve the quality of assembled genomes. However, both mate-pair libraries and the third-generation libraries require highmolecular-weight DNA, making the use of these libraries inappropriate for samples with only degraded DNA. An in silico method that generates mate-pair libraries using a reference genome was devised for the task of assembling target genomes. Although the contiguity and completeness of assembled genomes were significantly improved by this method, a high level of errors manifested in the assembly, further to which the methods for using reference genomes were not optimized. Here, we tested different strategies for using reference genomes to generate in silico mate-pairs. The results showed that using a closely related reference genome from the same genus was more effective than using divergent references. Conservation of in silico mate-pairs by comparing two references and using those to guide genome assembly reduced the number of misassemblies (18.6\% {\textendash} 46.1\%) and increased the contiguity of assembled genomes (9.7\% {\textendash} 70.7\%), while maintaining gene completeness at a level that was either similar or marginally lower than that obtained via the current method. Finally, we compared the optimized method with another reference-guided assembler, RaGOO. We found that RaGOO produced longer scaffolds (17.8 Mbp vs 3.0 Mbp), but resulted in a much higher misassembly rate (85.68\%) than our optimized in silico mate-pair method.},

  abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers new possibilities to address biological and medical questions. However, systematic comparisons of the performance of diverse scRNA-seq protocols are lacking. We generated data from 583 mouse embryonic stem cells to evaluate six prominent scRNA-seq methods: CEL-seq2, Drop-seq, MARS-seq, SCRB-seq, Smart-seq, and Smart-seq2. While Smart-seq2 detected the most genes per cell and across cells, CEL-seq2, Drop-seq, MARS-seq, and SCRB-seq quantified mRNA levels with less amplification noise due to the use of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Power simulations at different sequencing depths showed that Drop-seq is more cost-efficient for transcriptome quantification of large numbers of cells, while MARS-seq, SCRB-seq, and Smart-seq2 are more efficient when analyzing fewer cells. Our quantitative comparison offers the basis for an informed choice among six prominent scRNA-seq methods, and it provides a framework for benchmarking further improvements of scRNA-seq protocols.},
